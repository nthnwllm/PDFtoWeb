  <p>
   had to raise up legal heirs through various Old Testament practices. "The problem is made greater because some names are omitted, which was perfectly acceptable by standards of the ancient world. And there are textual variants-names, being translated from one language into another, often took on different spellings and were then easily confused for the name of a different individual." Blomberg had made his point: there are at least some rational explanations. Even if they might not be airtight, at least they provide a reasonable harmonization of the gospel accounts. Not wanting our conversation to degenerate into a stump-the- scholar  game, I decided to move on. In the meantime Blomberg and I agreed that the best overall approach would be to study each issue individually to see whether there's a rational way to resolve the apparent  conflict among the gospels. Certainly there's no shortage of authoritative books that thoroughly examine, sometimes in excruciating  detail, how these differences might be reconciled. "And," said Blomberg, "there are occasions when we may need to hold judgment in abeyance and simply say that since we've made sense out of the vast majority of the texts and determined them to be trustworthy, we can then give them the benefit of the doubt when we're not sure on some of the other details."
  </p>
  <h2>
   5. THE BIAS TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   This test analyzes whether the gospel writers had any biases that would have colored their work. Did they have any vested interest in skewing the material they were reporting on? "We can't underestimate the fact that these people loved Jesus," I pointed out. "They were not neutral observers; they were his devoted followers. Wouldn't that make it likely that they would change things to make him look good?" "Well, I'll concede this much," Blomberg replied, "it creates the potential for this to happen. But on the other hand, people can so honor and respect someone that it prompts them to record his life with great integrity. That's the way they would show their love for him. And I think that's what happened here. "Besides, these disciples had nothing to gain except criticism, ostracism, and martyrdom. They certainly had nothing to win financially.  If anything, this would have provided pressure to keep quiet, to deny Jesus, to downplay him, even to forget they ever met him yet  because of their integrity, they proclaimed what they saw, even when it meant suffering and death."
  </p>
  <h2>
   6. THE COVER-UP TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   When people testify about events they saw, they will often try to protect  themselves or others by conveniently forgetting to mention details that are embarrassing or hard to explain. As a result, this raises uncertainty about the veracity of their entire testimony. So I asked Blomberg, "Did the gospel writers include any material that might be embarrassing, or did they cover it up to make themselves  look good? Did they report anything that would be uncomfortable or difficult for them to explain?" "There's actually quite a bit along those lines," he said. "There's a large body of Jesus' teaching called the hard sayings of Jesus. Some of it is very ethically demanding. If I were inventing a religion to suit my fancy, I probably wouldn't tell myself to be as perfect as my heavenly  Father is perfect, or define adultery to include lust in my heart." "But," I protested, "there are demanding statements in other religions  as well." "Yes, that's true, which is why the more persuasive kind of hard sayings are those that could be embarrassing for what the church wanted to teach about Jesus." That response seemed vague. "Give me some examples," I said. Blomberg thought for a moment, then said, "For instance, Mark 6:5 says that Jesus could do few miracles in Nazareth because the people there had little faith, which seems to limit Jesus' power. Jesus said in Mark 13:32 that he didn't know the day or the hour of his return, which seems to limit his omniscience. "Now, ultimately theology hasn't had a problem with these statements,  because Paul himself, in Philippians 2:5-8, talks about God in Christ voluntarily and consciously limiting the independent exercise  of his divine attributes. "But if I felt free to play fast and loose with gospel history, it would be much more convenient to just leave out that material altogether,  and then I wouldn't have to go through the hassle of explaining  it. "Jesus' baptism is another example. You can explain why Jesus, who was without sin, allowed himself to be baptized, but why not make things easier by leaving it out altogether? On the cross Jesus cried out, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!'  It would have been in the self-interest of the writers to omit that because it raises too many questions."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Certainly," I added, "there's plenty of embarrassing material about the disciples." "Absolutely," Blomberg said. "Mark's perspective of Peter is pretty consistently unflattering. And he's the ringleader! The disciples repeatedly misunderstand Jesus. James and John want the places at Jesus' right and left hand, and he has to teach them hard lessons about servant leadership instead. They look like a bunch of self-serving,  self-seeking, dull-witted people a lot of the time. "Now, we already know that the gospel writers were selective; John's gospel ends by saying, somewhat hyperbolically, that the whole world couldn't contain all the information that could have been written  about Jesus. So had they left some of this out, that in and of itself wouldn't necessarily have been seen as falsifying the story. "But here's the point: if they didn't feel free to leave out stuff when it would have been convenient and helpful to do so, is it really plausible to believe that they outright added and fabricated material with no historical basis?" Blomberg let the question hang for a while before concluding with confidence, "I'd say not.'"
  </p>
  <h2>
   7. THE CORROBORATION TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I introduced this next test by asking Blomberg, "When the gospels mention people, places, and events, do they check out to be correct in cases in which they can be independently verified?" Often such corroboration is invaluable in assessing whether a writer has a commitment  to accuracy. "Yes, they do, and the longer people explore this, the more the details get confirmed," Blomberg replied. "Within the last hundred years archaeology has repeatedly unearthed discoveries that have confirmed specific references in the gospels, particularly the gospel of John-ironically, the one that's supposedly so suspect! "Now, yes, there are still some unresolved issues, and there have been times when archaeology has created new problems, but those are a tiny minority compared with the number of examples of corroboration. "In addition, we can learn through non-Christian sources a lot of facts about Jesus that corroborate key teachings and events in his life. And when you stop to think that ancient historians for the most part dealt only with political rulers, emperors, kings, military battles, official religious people, and major philosophical movements, it's remarkable how much we can learn about Jesus and his followers even though they fit none of those categories at the time these historians were writing." That was a concise and helpful answer. However, while I had no reason to doubt Blomberg's assessment, I decided it would be worthwhile  to do some further research along these lines. I picked up my pen and jotted a reminder to myself in the margin of my notes: Get expert opinions from archaeologist and historian.
  </p>
  <h2>
   8. THE ADVERSE WITNESS TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   This test asks the question, Were others present who would have contradicted  or corrected the gospels if they had been distorted or false? In other words, do we see examples of contemporaries of Jesus complaining  that the gospel accounts were just plain wrong? "Many people had reasons for wanting to discredit this movement and would have done so if they could have simply told history better,"  Blomberg said. "Yet look at what his opponents did say. In later Jewish writings Jesus is called a sorcerer who led Israel astray-which acknowledges that he really did work marvelous wonders, although the writers dispute  the source of his power. "This would have been a perfect opportunity to say something like, 'The Christians will tell you he worked miracles, but we're here to tell you he didn't.' Yet that's the one thing we never see his opponents  saying. Instead they implicitly acknowledge that what the gospels wrote-that Jesus performed miracles-is true." I asked, "Could this Christian movement have taken root right there in Jerusalem-in the very area where Jesus had done much of his ministry, had been crucified, buried, and resurrected-if people who knew him were aware that the disciples were exaggerating or distorting  the things that he did?" "I don't believe so," Blomberg replied. "We have a picture of what was initially a very vulnerable and fragile movement that was being subjected to persecution. If critics could have attacked it on the basis that it was full of falsehoods or distortions, they would have. "But," he emphasized in conclusion, "that's exactly what we don't see."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Certainly," I added, "there's plenty of embarrassing material about the disciples." "Absolutely," Blomberg said. "Mark's perspective of Peter is pretty consistently unflattering. And he's the ringleader! The disciples repeatedly misunderstand Jesus. James and John want the places at Jesus' right and left hand, and he has to teach them hard lessons about servant leadership instead. They look like a bunch of self-serving,  self-seeking, dull-witted people a lot of the time. "Now, we already know that the gospel writers were selective; John's gospel ends by saying, somewhat hyperbolically, that the whole world couldn't contain all the information that could have been written  about Jesus. So had they left some of this out, that in and of itself wouldn't necessarily have been seen as falsifying the story. "But here's the point: if they didn't feel free to leave out stuff when it would have been convenient and helpful to do so, is it really plausible to believe that they outright added and fabricated material with no historical basis?" Blomberg let the question hang for a while before concluding with confidence, "I'd say not."

  <h2>
   A FAITH BUTTRESSED BY FACTS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I'll admit I was impressed by Blomberg. Informed and articulate, scholarly and convincing, he had constructed a strong case for the reliability of the gospels. His evidence for their traditional authorship,  his analysis of the extremely early date of fundamental beliefs about Jesus, his well-reasoned defense of the accuracy of the oral tradition,  his thoughtful examination of apparent discrepancies-all of his testimony had established a solid foundation for me to build on. Yet there was still a long way to go in determining whether Jesus is the unique Son of God. In fact, after talking with Blomberg, my next assignment became clear: figure out whether these gospels, shown by Blomberg to be so trustworthy, have been reliably handed down to us over the centuries. How can we be sure that the texts we're reading today bear any resemblance to what was originally written in the first century? What's more, how do we know that the gospels are telling
