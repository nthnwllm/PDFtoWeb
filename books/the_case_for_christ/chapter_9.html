  <p>
   had to raise up legal heirs through various Old Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   practices.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The problem is made greater because some names are omitted,
  </p>
  <p>
   which was perfectly acceptable by standards of the ancient world.
  </p>
  <p>
   And there are textual variants-names, being translated from one
  </p>
  <p>
   language into another, often took on different spellings and were
  </p>
  <p>
   then easily confused for the name of a different individual."
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg had made his point: there are at least some rational
  </p>
  <p>
   explanations. Even if they might not be airtight, at least they
  </p>
  <p>
   provide a reasonable harmonization of the gospel accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Not wanting our conversation to degenerate into a stump-the-
  </p>
  <p>
   scholar  game, I decided to move on. In the meantime Blomberg and
  </p>
  <p>
   I agreed that the best overall approach would be to study each
  </p>
  <p>
   issue individually to see whether there's a rational way to
  </p>
  <p>
   resolve the apparent  conflict among the gospels. Certainly
  </p>
  <p>
   there's no shortage of authoritative books that thoroughly
  </p>
  <p>
   examine, sometimes in excruciating  detail, how these differences
  </p>
  <p>
   might be reconciled.
  </p>
  <p>
   "And," said Blomberg, "there are occasions when we may need to
  </p>
  <p>
   hold judgment in abeyance and simply say that since we've made
  </p>
  <p>
   sense out of the vast majority of the texts and determined them
  </p>
  <p>
   to be trustworthy, we can then give them the benefit of the doubt
  </p>
  <p>
   when we're not sure on some of the other details."
  </p>
  <h2>
   5. THE BIAS TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   This test analyzes whether the gospel writers had any biases that
  </p>
  <p>
   would have colored their work. Did they have any vested interest
  </p>
  <p>
   in skewing the material they were reporting on?
  </p>
  <p>
   "We can't underestimate the fact that these people loved Jesus,"
  </p>
  <p>
   I pointed out. "They were not neutral observers; they were his
  </p>
  <p>
   devoted followers. Wouldn't that make it likely that they would
  </p>
  <p>
   change things to make him look good?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, I'll concede this much," Blomberg replied, "it creates the
  </p>
  <p>
   potential for this to happen. But on the other hand, people can
  </p>
  <p>
   so honor and respect someone that it prompts them to record his
  </p>
  <p>
   life with great integrity. That's the way they would show their
  </p>
  <p>
   love for him. And I think that's what happened here.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Besides, these disciples had nothing to gain except criticism,
  </p>
  <p>
   ostracism, and martyrdom. They certainly had nothing to win
  </p>
  <p>
   financially.  If anything, this would have provided pressure to
  </p>
  <p>
   keep quiet, to deny Jesus, to downplay him, even to forget they
  </p>
  <p>
   ever met him yet  because of their integrity, they proclaimed
  </p>
  <p>
   what they saw, even when it meant suffering and death."
  </p>
  <h2>
   6. THE COVER-UP TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   When people testify about events they saw, they will often try to
  </p>
  <p>
   protect  themselves or others by conveniently forgetting to
  </p>
  <p>
   mention details that are embarrassing or hard to explain. As a
  </p>
  <p>
   result, this raises uncertainty about the veracity of their
  </p>
  <p>
   entire testimony.
  </p>
  <p>
   So I asked Blomberg, "Did the gospel writers include any material
  </p>
  <p>
   that might be embarrassing, or did they cover it up to make
  </p>
  <p>
   themselves  look good? Did they report anything that would be
  </p>
  <p>
   uncomfortable or difficult for them to explain?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "There's actually quite a bit along those lines," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "There's a large body of Jesus' teaching called the hard sayings
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus. Some of it is very ethically demanding. If I were
  </p>
  <p>
   inventing a religion to suit my fancy, I probably wouldn't tell
  </p>
  <p>
   myself to be as perfect as my heavenly  Father is perfect, or
  </p>
  <p>
   define adultery to include lust in my heart." "But," I protested,
  </p>
  <p>
   "there are demanding statements in other religions  as well."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, that's true, which is why the more persuasive kind of hard
  </p>
  <p>
   sayings are those that could be embarrassing for what the church
  </p>
  <p>
   wanted to teach about Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   That response seemed vague. "Give me some examples," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg thought for a moment, then said, "For instance, Mark 6:5
  </p>
  <p>
   says that Jesus could do few miracles in Nazareth because the
  </p>
  <p>
   people there had little faith, which seems to limit Jesus' power.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus said in Mark 13:32 that he didn't know the day or the hour
  </p>
  <p>
   of his return, which seems to limit his omniscience.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Now, ultimately theology hasn't had a problem with these
  </p>
  <p>
   statements,  because Paul himself, in Philippians 2:5-8, talks
  </p>
  <p>
   about God in Christ voluntarily and consciously limiting the
  </p>
  <p>
   independent exercise  of his divine attributes.
  </p>
  <p>
   "But if I felt free to play fast and loose with gospel history,
  </p>
  <p>
   it would be much more convenient to just leave out that material
  </p>
  <p>
   altogether,  and then I wouldn't have to go through the hassle of
  </p>
  <p>
   explaining  it.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Jesus' baptism is another example. You can explain why Jesus,
  </p>
  <p>
   who was without sin, allowed himself to be baptized, but why not
  </p>
  <p>
   make things easier by leaving it out altogether? On the cross
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus cried out, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!'  It
  </p>
  <p>
   would have been in the self-interest of the writers to omit that
  </p>
  <p>
   because it raises too many questions."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Certainly," I added, "there's plenty of embarrassing material
  </p>
  <p>
   about the disciples."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Absolutely," Blomberg said. "Mark's perspective of Peter is
  </p>
  <p>
   pretty consistently unflattering. And he's the ringleader! The
  </p>
  <p>
   disciples repeatedly misunderstand Jesus. James and John want the
  </p>
  <p>
   places at Jesus' right and left hand, and he has to teach them
  </p>
  <p>
   hard lessons about servant leadership instead. They look like a
  </p>
  <p>
   bunch of self-serving,  self-seeking, dull-witted people a lot of
  </p>
  <p>
   the time.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Now, we already know that the gospel writers were selective;
  </p>
  <p>
   John's gospel ends by saying, somewhat hyperbolically, that the
  </p>
  <p>
   whole world couldn't contain all the information that could have
  </p>
  <p>
   been written  about Jesus. So had they left some of this out,
  </p>
  <p>
   that in and of itself wouldn't necessarily have been seen as
  </p>
  <p>
   falsifying the story. "But here's the point: if they didn't feel
  </p>
  <p>
   free to leave out stuff when it would have been convenient and
  </p>
  <p>
   helpful to do so, is it really plausible to believe that they
  </p>
  <p>
   outright added and fabricated material with no historical basis?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg let the question hang for a while before concluding with
  </p>
  <p>
   confidence, "I'd say not.'"
  </p>
  <h2>
   7. THE CORROBORATION TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I introduced this next test by asking Blomberg, "When the gospels
  </p>
  <p>
   mention people, places, and events, do they check out to be
  </p>
  <p>
   correct in cases in which they can be independently verified?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Often such corroboration is invaluable in assessing whether a
  </p>
  <p>
   writer has a commitment  to accuracy.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, they do, and the longer people explore this, the more the
  </p>
  <p>
   details get confirmed," Blomberg replied. "Within the last
  </p>
  <p>
   hundred years archaeology has repeatedly unearthed discoveries
  </p>
  <p>
   that have confirmed specific references in the gospels,
  </p>
  <p>
   particularly the gospel of John-ironically, the one that's
  </p>
  <p>
   supposedly so suspect!
  </p>
  <p>
   "Now, yes, there are still some unresolved issues, and there have
  </p>
  <p>
   been times when archaeology has created new problems, but those
  </p>
  <p>
   are a tiny minority compared with the number of examples of
  </p>
  <p>
   corroboration.
  </p>
  <p>
   "In addition, we can learn through non-Christian sources a lot of
  </p>
  <p>
   facts about Jesus that corroborate key teachings and events in
  </p>
  <p>
   his life. And when you stop to think that ancient historians for
  </p>
  <p>
   the most part dealt only with political rulers, emperors, kings,
  </p>
  <p>
   military battles, official religious people, and major
  </p>
  <p>
   philosophical movements, it's remarkable how much we can learn
  </p>
  <p>
   about Jesus and his followers even though they fit none of those
  </p>
  <p>
   categories at the time these historians were writing." That was a
  </p>
  <p>
   concise and helpful answer. However, while I had no reason to
  </p>
  <p>
   doubt Blomberg's assessment, I decided it would be worthwhile  to
  </p>
  <p>
   do some further research along these lines. I picked up my pen
  </p>
  <p>
   and jotted a reminder to myself in the margin of my notes: Get
  </p>
  <p>
   expert opinions from archaeologist and historian.
  </p>
  <h2>
   8. THE ADVERSE WITNESS TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   This test asks the question, Were others present who would have
  </p>
  <p>
   contradicted  or corrected the gospels if they had been distorted
  </p>
  <p>
   or false? In other words, do we see examples of contemporaries of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus complaining  that the gospel accounts were just plain
  </p>
  <p>
   wrong?
  </p>
  <p>
   "Many people had reasons for wanting to discredit this movement
  </p>
  <p>
   and would have done so if they could have simply told history
  </p>
  <p>
   better,"  Blomberg said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yet look at what his opponents did say. In later Jewish writings
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus is called a sorcerer who led Israel astray-which
  </p>
  <p>
   acknowledges that he really did work marvelous wonders, although
  </p>
  <p>
   the writers dispute  the source of his power.
  </p>
  <p>
   "This would have been a perfect opportunity to say something
  </p>
  <p>
   like, 'The Christians will tell you he worked miracles, but we're
  </p>
  <p>
   here to tell you he didn't.' Yet that's the one thing we never
  </p>
  <p>
   see his opponents  saying. Instead they implicitly acknowledge
  </p>
  <p>
   that what the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels wrote-that Jesus performed miracles-is true."
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked, "Could this Christian movement have taken root right
  </p>
  <p>
   there in Jerusalem-in the very area where Jesus had done much of
  </p>
  <p>
   his ministry, had been crucified, buried, and resurrected-if
  </p>
  <p>
   people who knew him were aware that the disciples were
  </p>
  <p>
   exaggerating or distorting  the things that he did?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "I don't believe so," Blomberg replied. "We have a picture of

  <p>
   what was initially a very vulnerable and fragile movement that
  </p>
  <p>
   was being subjected to persecution. If critics could have
  </p>
  <p>
   attacked it on the basis that it was full of falsehoods or
  </p>
  <p>
   distortions, they would have. "But," he emphasized in conclusion,
  </p>
  <p>
   "that's exactly what we don't see."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Certainly," I added, "there's plenty of embarrassing material
  </p>
  <p>
   about the disciples."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Absolutely," Blomberg said. "Mark's perspective of Peter is
  </p>
  <p>
   pretty consistently unflattering. And he's the ringleader! The
  </p>
  <p>
   disciples repeatedly misunderstand Jesus. James and John want the
  </p>
  <p>
   places at Jesus' right and left hand, and he has to teach them
  </p>
  <p>
   hard lessons about servant leadership instead. They look like a
  </p>
  <p>
   bunch of self-serving,  self-seeking, dull-witted people a lot of
  </p>
  <p>
   the time.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Now, we already know that the gospel writers were selective;
  </p>
  <p>
   John's gospel ends by saying, somewhat hyperbolically, that the
  </p>
  <p>
   whole world couldn't contain all the information that could have
  </p>
  <p>
   been written  about Jesus. So had they left some of this out,
  </p>
  <p>
   that in and of itself wouldn't necessarily have been seen as
  </p>
  <p>
   falsifying the story. "But here's the point: if they didn't feel
  </p>
  <p>
   free to leave out stuff when it would have been convenient and
  </p>
  <p>
   helpful to do so, is it really plausible to believe that they
  </p>
  <p>
   outright added and fabricated material with no historical basis?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg let the question hang for a while before concluding with
  </p>
  <p>
   confidence, "I'd say not."
  </p>
  <h2>
   A FAITH BUTTRESSED BY FACTS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I'll admit I was impressed by Blomberg. Informed and articulate,
  </p>
  <p>
   scholarly and convincing, he had constructed a strong case for
  </p>
  <p>
   the reliability of the gospels. His evidence for their
  </p>
  <p>
   traditional authorship,  his analysis of the extremely early date
  </p>
  <p>
   of fundamental beliefs about Jesus, his well-reasoned defense of
  </p>
  <p>
   the accuracy of the oral tradition,  his thoughtful examination
  </p>
  <p>
   of apparent discrepancies-all of his testimony had established a
  </p>
  <p>
   solid foundation for me to build on. Yet there was still a long
  </p>
  <p>
   way to go in determining whether Jesus is the unique Son of God.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, after talking with Blomberg, my next assignment became
  </p>
  <p>
   clear: figure out whether these gospels, shown by Blomberg to be
  </p>
  <p>
   so trustworthy, have been reliably handed down to us over the
  </p>
  <p>
   centuries. How can we be sure that the texts we're reading today
  </p>
  <p>
   bear any resemblance to what was originally written in the first
  </p>
  <p>
   century? What's more, how do we know that the gospels are telling
