  <p>
   actually, scrolls of papyrus-were relatively rare. Therefore
  </p>
  <p>
   education, learning, worship, teaching in religious communities-
  </p>
  <p>
   all this was done by word of mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rabbis became famous for having the entire Old Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   committed to memory. So it would have been well within the
  </p>
  <p>
   capability  of Jesus' disciples to have committed much more to
  </p>
  <p>
   memory
  </p>
  <p>
   than appears in all four gospels put together-and to have passed
  </p>
  <p>
   it along accurately."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Wait a second," I interjected. "Frankly, that kind of
  </p>
  <p>
   memorization  seems incredible. How is that possible?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, it is difficult for us to imagine today," he conceded, "but
  </p>
  <p>
   this was an oral culture, in which there was great emphasis
  </p>
  <p>
   placed on memorization. And remember that eighty to ninety
  </p>
  <p>
   percent of Jesus' words were originally in poetic form. This
  </p>
  <p>
   doesn't mean stuff that rhymes, but it has a meter, balanced
  </p>
  <p>
   lines, parallelism, and so forth-and this would have created a
  </p>
  <p>
   great memory help.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other thing that needs to be said is that the definition of
  </p>
  <p>
   memorization was more flexible back then. In studies of cultures
  </p>
  <p>
   with oral traditions, there was freedom to vary how much of the
  </p>
  <p>
   story was told on any given occasion-what was included, what was
  </p>
  <p>
   left out, what was paraphrased, what was explained, and so forth.
  </p>
  <p>
   One study suggested that in the ancient Middle East, anywhere
  </p>
  <p>
   from ten to forty percent of any given retelling of sacred
  </p>
  <p>
   tradition could vary from one occasion to the next. However,
  </p>
  <p>
   there were always fixed points that were unalterable, and the
  </p>
  <p>
   community had the right to intervene and correct the storyteller
  </p>
  <p>
   if he erred on those important aspects of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's an interesting" -he paused, searching his mind for the right
  </p>
  <p>
   word- "coincidence that ten to forty percent is pretty
  </p>
  <p>
   consistently the amount of variation among the synoptics on any
  </p>
  <p>
   given passage." Blomberg was hinting at something; I wanted him
  </p>
  <p>
   to be more
  </p>
  <p>
   explicit. "Spell it out for me," I said. "What precisely are you
  </p>
  <p>
   saying?" "I'm saying that it's likely that a lot of the
  </p>
  <p>
   similarities and differences  among the synoptics can be
  </p>
  <p>
   explained by assuming that the
  </p>
  <p>
   disciples and other early Christians had committed to memory a
  </p>
  <p>
   lot of what Jesus said and did, but they felt free to recount
  </p>
  <p>
   this information  in various forms, always preserving the
  </p>
  <p>
   significance of Jesus' original teachings and deeds."
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, I had some question about the ability of these early
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians  to accurately preserve this oral tradition. I had too
  </p>
  <p>
   many memories  of childhood party games in which words got
  </p>
  <p>
   garbled within a matter of minutes.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Playing Telephone
  </p>
  <p>
   You've probably played the game of telephone yourself. one child
  </p>
  <p>
   whispers something into another child's ear-for instance, "You're
  </p>
  <p>
   my best friend"-and this gets whispered to others around a big
  </p>
  <p>
   circle  until at the end it comes out grossly distorted-perhaps,
  </p>
  <p>
   "You're a brutish fiend."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let's be candid," I said to Blomberg. "Isn't this a good analogy
  </p>
  <p>
   for what probably happened to the oral tradition about Jesus?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg wasn't buying that explanation. "No, not really," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said. "Here's why: When you're carefully memorizing something and
  </p>
  <p>
   taking care not to pass it along until you're sure you've got it
  </p>
  <p>
   right, you're doing something very different from playing the
  </p>
  <p>
   game of telephone.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "In telephone half the fun is that the person may not have got it
  </p>
  <p>
   right or even heard it right the first time, and they cannot ask
  </p>
  <p>
   the person  to repeat it. Then you immediately pass it along,
  </p>
  <p>
   also in whispered  tones that make it more likely the next person
  </p>
  <p>
   will goof
  </p>
  <p>
   something up even more. So yes, by the time it has circulated
  </p>
  <p>
   through a room of thirty people, the results can be hilarious."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Then why," I asked, "isn't that a good analogy for passing along
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient oral tradition?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg sipped his coffee before answering. "If you really
  </p>
  <p>
   wanted to develop that analogy in light of the checks and
  </p>
  <p>
   balances of the first-century community, you'd have to say that
  </p>
  <p>
   every third person, out loud in a very clear voice, would have to
  </p>
  <p>
   ask the first person, 'Do I still have it right?' and change it
  </p>
  <p>
   if he didn't.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The community would constantly be monitoring what was said and
  </p>
  <p>
   intervening to make corrections along the way. That would
  </p>
  <p>
   preserve  the integrity of the message," he said. "And the result
  </p>
  <p>
   would be very different from that of a childish game of
  </p>
  <p>
   telephone."
  </p>
  <h2>
   3. THE CHARACTER TEST
  </h2>
  <p>
   This test looks at whether it was in the character of these
  </p>
  <p>
   writers to be truthful. Was there any evidence of dishonesty or
  </p>
  <p>
   immorality that might taint their ability or willingness to
  </p>
  <p>
   transmit history accurately? Blomberg shook his head. "We simply
  </p>
  <p>
   do not have any reasonable  evidence to suggest they were
  </p>
  <p>
   anything but people of great integrity," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "We see them reporting the words and actions of a man who
  </p>
  <p>
   called them to as exacting a level of integrity as any religion
  </p>
  <p>
   has ever known. They were willing to live out their beliefs even
  </p>
  <p>
   to the point of ten of the eleven remaining disciples being put
  </p>
  <p>
   to grisly deaths, which shows great character.
  </p>
  <p>
   "In terms of honesty, in terms of truthfulness, in terms of
  </p>
  <p>
   virtue and morality, these people had a track record that should
  </p>
  <p>
   be envied."
  </p>
  <h2>
   4. THE CONSISTENCY TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Here's a test that skeptics often charge the gospels with
  </p>
  <p>
   failing. After all, aren't they hopelessly contradictory with
  </p>
  <p>
   each other? Aren't there irreconcilable discrepancies among the
  </p>
  <p>
   various gospel accounts? And if there are, how can anyone trust
  </p>
  <p>
   anything they say?
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg acknowledged that there are numerous points at which the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels appear to disagree. "These range all the way from very
  </p>
  <p>
   minor variations in wording to the most famous apparent
  </p>
  <p>
   contradictions,"  he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "My own conviction is, once you allow for the elements I've
  </p>
  <p>
   talked about earlier-of paraphrase, of abridgment, of explanatory
  </p>
  <p>
   additions, of selection, of omission-the gospels are extremely
  </p>
  <p>
   consistent  with each other by ancient standards, which are the
  </p>
  <p>
   only standards  by which it's fair to judge them."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Ironically," I pointed out, "if the gospels had been identical
  </p>
  <p>
   to each other, word for word, this would have raised charges that
  </p>
  <p>
   the authors had conspired among themselves to coordinate their
  </p>
  <p>
   stories in advance, and that would have cast doubt on them."
  </p>
  <p>
   "That's right," Blomberg agreed. "If the gospels were too
  </p>
  <p>
   consistent,  that in itself would invalidate them as independent
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses. People would then say we really only have one
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony that everybody  else is just parroting."
  </p>
  <p>
   My mind flashed to the words of Simon Greenleaf of Harvard Law
  </p>
  <p>
   School, one of history's most important legal figures and the
  </p>
  <p>
   author of an influential treatise on evidence. After studying the
  </p>
  <p>
   consistency among the four gospel writers, he offered this
  </p>
  <p>
   evaluation: "There is enough of a discrepancy to show that there
  </p>
  <p>
   could have been no previous  concert among them; and at the same
  </p>
  <p>
   time such substantial
  </p>
  <p>
   agreement as to show that they all were independent narrators of
  </p>
  <p>
   the same great transaction  ."
  </p>
  <p>
   From the perspective of a classical historian, German scholar
  </p>
  <p>
   Hans Stier has concurred that agreement over basic data and
  </p>
  <p>
   divergence  of details suggest credibility, because fabricated
  </p>
  <p>
   accounts tend to be fully consistent and harmonized. "Every
  </p>
  <p>
   historian," he wrote, "is especially skeptical at that moment
  </p>
  <p>
   when an extraordinary happening  is only reported in accounts
  </p>
  <p>
   which are completely free of contradictions."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While that's true, I didn't want to ignore the difficulties that
  </p>
  <p>
   are raised by the ostensible discrepancies among the gospels. I
  </p>
  <p>
   decided to probe the issue further by pressing Blomberg on some
  </p>
  <p>
   apparent clear-cut contradictions that skeptics frequently seize
  </p>
  <p>
   upon as examples  of why the gospels are unreliable.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Coping with Contradictions
  </p>
  <p>
   I began with a well-known story of a healing. "In Matthew it says
  </p>
  <p>
   a centurion himself came to ask Jesus to heal his servant," I
  </p>
  <p>
   pointed out. "However, Luke says the centurion sent the elders to
  </p>
  <p>
   do this. Now, that's an obvious contradiction, isn't it?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "No, I don't think so," Blomberg replied. "Think about it this
  </p>
  <p>
   way: in our world today, we may hear a news report that says,
  </p>
  <p>
   'The president today announced that . . .' when in fact the
  </p>
  <p>
   speech was written  by a speechwriter and delivered by the press
  </p>
  <p>
   secretary-and with a little luck, the president might have
  </p>
  <p>
   glanced at it somewhere in between. Yet nobody accuses that
  </p>
  <p>
   broadcast of being in error. "In a similar way, in the ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   world it was perfectly understood and accepted that actions were
  </p>
  <p>
   often attributed to people when in fact they occurred through
  </p>
  <p>
   their subordinates or emissaries-in this case through the elders
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Jewish people."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So you're saying that Matthew and Luke can both be right at the
  </p>
  <p>
   same time?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "That's exactly what I'm saying," he replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   That seemed plausible, so I posed a second example. "What
  </p>
  <p>
   about Mark and Luke saying that Jesus sent the demons into the
  </p>
  <p>
   swine at Gerasa, while Matthew says it was in Gadara. People look
  </p>
  <p>
   at that and say this is an obvious contradiction that cannot be
  </p>
  <p>
   reconciled-it's  two different places. Case closed."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, don't shut the case yet," Blomberg chuckled. "Here's one
  </p>
  <p>
   possible solution: one was a town; the other was a province."
  </p>
  <p>
   That seemed a little too glib for me. He appeared to be skimming
  </p>
  <p>
   over the real difficulties that are raised by this issue.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It gets more complicated than that," I said. "Gerasa, the town,
  </p>
  <p>
   wasn't anywhere near the Sea of Galilee, yet that's where the
  </p>
  <p>
   demons, after going into the swine, supposedly took the herd over
  </p>
  <p>
   the cliff to their deaths."
  </p>
  <p>
   "OK, good point," he said. "But there have been ruins of a town
  </p>
  <p>
   that have been excavated at exactly the right point on the
  </p>
  <p>
   eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The English form of the
  </p>
  <p>
   town's name often gets pronounced 'Khersa,' but as a Hebrew word
  </p>
  <p>
   translated or transliterated  into Greek, it could have come out
  </p>
  <p>
   sounding something very much like 'Gerasa.' So it may very well
  </p>
  <p>
   have been in Khersa-whose spelling in Greek was rendered as
  </p>
  <p>
   Gerasa-in the province of Gadara."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well done," I conceded with a smile. "I'll surrender on that
  </p>
  <p>
   one. But here's a problem that's not so easy: what about the
  </p>
  <p>
   discrepancies between the genealogies of Jesus in Matthew and
  </p>
  <p>
   Luke? Skeptics often point to them as being hopelessly in
  </p>
  <p>
   conflict."
  </p>
  <p>
   "This is another case of multiple options," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Such as?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "The two most common have been that Matthew reflects Joseph's
  </p>
  <p>
   lineage, because most of his opening chapter is told from
  </p>
  <p>
   Joseph's perspective and Joseph, as the adoptive father, would
  </p>
  <p>
   have been the legal ancestor through whom Jesus' royal lineage
  </p>
  <p>
   would have been traced. These are themes that are important for
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Luke, then, would have traced the genealogy through Mary's
  </p>
  <p>
   lineage.  And since both are from the ancestry of David, once you
  </p>
  <p>
   get that far back the lines converge.
  </p>
  <p>
   "A second option is that both genealogies reflect Joseph's
  </p>
  <p>
   lineage in order to create the necessary legalities. But one is
  </p>
  <p>
   Joseph's human lineage-the gospel of Luke-and the other is
  </p>
  <p>
   Joseph's legal lineage, with the two diverging at the points
  </p>
  <p>
   where somebody in the line did not have a direct offspring. They
