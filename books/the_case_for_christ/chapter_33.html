  <p>
   Jesus as irrelevant to Jesus as Messiah. "As you know, I came
  </p>
  <p>
   from a Jewish family," he began. "I attended a conservative
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish synagogue for seven years in preparation for bar mitzvah.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although we considered those studies to be very important, our
  </p>
  <p>
   family's faith didn't affect our everyday life very much. We
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't stop work on the Sabbath; we didn't have a kosher home."
  </p>
  <p>
   He smiled. "However, on the High Holy Days we attended the
  </p>
  <p>
   stricter Orthodox synagogue, because somehow my dad felt that's
  </p>
  <p>
   where you went if you really wanted to get serious with God!"
  </p>
  <p>
   When I interjected to ask what his parents had taught him about
  </p>
  <p>
   the Messiah, Lapides' answer was crisp. "It never came up," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said matter-of-factly.
  </p>
  <p>
   I was incredulous. In fact, I thought I had misunderstood him.
  </p>
  <p>
   "You're saying it wasn't even discussed?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Never," he reiterated. "I don't even remember it being an issue
  </p>
  <p>
   in Hebrew school."
  </p>
  <p>
   This was amazing to me. "How about Jesus?" I asked. "Was he ever
  </p>
  <p>
   talked about? Was his name used?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Only derogatorily?" Lapides quipped. "Basically, he was never
  </p>
  <p>
   discussed. My impressions of Jesus came from seeing Catholic
  </p>
  <p>
   churches: there was the cross, the crown of thorns, the pierced
  </p>
  <p>
   side, the blood coming from his head. It didn't make any sense to
  </p>
  <p>
   me. Why would you worship a man on a cross with nails in his
  </p>
  <p>
   hands and his feet? I never once thought Jesus had any connection
  </p>
  <p>
   to the Jewish people. I just thought he was a god of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Gentiles."
  </p>
  <p>
   I suspected that Lapides' attitudes toward Christians had gone
  </p>
  <p>
   beyond mere confusion over their beliefs. "Did you believe
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians  were at the root of anti-Semitism?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Gentiles were looked upon as synonymous with Christians, and we
  </p>
  <p>
   were taught to be cautious because there could be anti-Semitism
  </p>
  <p>
   among the Gentiles," he said, sounding a bit diplomatic.
  </p>
  <p>
   I pursued the issue further. "Would you say you developed some
  </p>
  <p>
   negative attitudes toward Christians?"
  </p>
  <p>
   This time he didn't mince words. "Yes, actually I did," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "In fact, later when the New Testament was first presented to me,
  </p>
  <p>
   I sincerely thought it was going to basically be a handbook on
  </p>
  <p>
   antiSemitism:  how to hate Jews, how to kill Jews, how to
  </p>
  <p>
   massacre them.
  </p>
  <p>
   I thought the American Nazi Party would have been very
  </p>
  <p>
   comfortable using it as a guidebook."
  </p>
  <p>
   I shook my head, saddened at the thought of how many other Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   children have grown up thinking of Christians as their enemies.
  </p>
  <h2>
   A SPIRITUAL QUEST BEGINS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Lapides said several incidents dimmed his allegiance to Judaism
  </p>
  <p>
   as he was growing up. Curious about the details, I asked him to
  </p>
  <p>
   elaborate,  and he immediately turned to what was clearly the
  </p>
  <p>
   most
  </p>
  <p>
   heart rending episode of his life.
  </p>
  <p>
   "My parents got divorced when I was seventeen," he said-and
  </p>
  <p>
   surprisingly, even after all these years I could still detect
  </p>
  <p>
   hurt in his voice. "That really put a stake in any religious
  </p>
  <p>
   heart I may have had. I wondered, Where does God come in? Why
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't they go to a rabbi for counseling? What good is religion
  </p>
  <p>
   if it can't help people in a practical way? It sure couldn't keep
  </p>
  <p>
   my parents together. When they split up, part of me split as
  </p>
  <p>
   well.
  </p>
  <p>
   On top of that, in Judaism I didn't feel as if I had a personal
  </p>
  <p>
   relationship  with God. I had a lot of beautiful ceremonies and
  </p>
  <p>
   traditions, but he was the distant and detached God of Mount
  </p>
  <p>
   Sinai who said, 'Here are the rules-you live by them, you'll be
  </p>
  <p>
   OK; I'll see you later.' And there I was, an adolescent with
  </p>
  <p>
   raging hormones, wondering, Does God relate to my struggles? Does
  </p>
  <p>
   he care about me as an individual?  Well, not in any way I could
  </p>
  <p>
   see."
  </p>
  <p>
   The divorce prompted an era of rebellion. Consumed with music and
  </p>
  <p>
   influenced by the writings of Jack Kerouac and Timothy Leary, he
  </p>
  <p>
   spent too much time in Greenwich Village coffeehouses to go to
  </p>
  <p>
   college-making him vulnerable to the draft. By 1967 he found
  </p>
  <p>
   himself  on the other side of the world in a cargo boat whose
  </p>
  <p>
   volatile freight-ammunition, bombs, rockets, and other high
  </p>
  <p>
   explosivesmade  it a tempting target for the Vietcong.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I remember being told at our orientation in Vietnam, 'Twenty
  </p>
  <p>
   percent of you will probably get killed, and the other eighty
  </p>
  <p>
   percent will probably get a venereal disease or become alcoholics
  </p>
  <p>
   or get hooked on drugs.' I thought, I don't even have a one
  </p>
  <p>
   percent chance of coming out normal!
  </p>
  <p>
   It was a very dark period. I witnessed suffering. I saw body
  </p>
  <p>
   bags; I saw the devastation from war. And I encountered anti-
  </p>
  <p>
   Semitism among some of the GIs. A few of them from the South even
  </p>
  <p>
   burned a cross one night. I probably wanted to distance myself
  </p>
  <p>
   from my Jewish identity-maybe that's why I began delving into
  </p>
  <p>
   Eastern religions." Lapides read books on Eastern philosophies
  </p>
  <p>
   and visited Buddhist temples while in Japan. "I was extremely
  </p>
  <p>
   bothered by the evil I had seen, and I was trying to figure out
  </p>
  <p>
   how faith can deal with it," he told me. "I used to say, 'If
  </p>
  <p>
   there's a God, I don't care if I find him on Mount Sinai or Mount
  </p>
  <p>
   Fuji. I'll take him either way.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   He survived Vietnam, returning home with a new found taste for
  </p>
  <p>
   marijuana and plans to become a Buddhist priest. He tried to live
  </p>
  <p>
   an ascetic lifestyle of self-denial in an effort to work off the
  </p>
  <p>
   bad karma for the misdeeds of his past, but soon he realized he'd
  </p>
  <p>
   never be able to make up for all his wrongs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lapides was quiet for a moment. "I got depressed," he said. "I
  </p>
  <p>
   remember getting on the subway and thinking, Maybe jumping onto
  </p>
  <p>
   the tracks is the answer. I could free myself from this body and
  </p>
  <p>
   just merge with God. I was very confused. To make matters worse,
  </p>
  <p>
   I started experimenting with LSD."
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking for a new start, he decided to move to California, where,
  </p>
  <p>
   his spiritual quest continued. "I went to Buddhist meetings, but
  </p>
  <p>
   that was empty," he said. "Chinese Buddhism was atheistic,
  </p>
  <p>
   Japanese Buddhism worshiped statues of Buddha, Zen Buddhism was
  </p>
  <p>
   too elusive.  I went to Scientology meetings, but they were too
  </p>
  <p>
   manipulative and controlling. Hinduism believed in all these
  </p>
  <p>
   crazy orgies that the gods would have and in gods who were blue
  </p>
  <p>
   elephants. None of it made sense; none of it was satisfying."
  </p>
  <p>
   He even accompanied friends to meetings that had Satanic
  </p>
  <p>
   undercurrents. "I would watch and think, Something is going on
  </p>
  <p>
   here, but it's not good," he said. "In the midst of my drug-
  </p>
  <p>
   crazed world, I told my friends I believed there's a power of
  </p>
  <p>
   evil that's beyond me, that can work in me, that exists as an
  </p>
  <p>
   entity. I had seen enough evil in my life to believe that."
  </p>
  <p>
   He looked at me with an ironic smile. "I guess I accepted Satan's
  </p>
  <p>
   existence," he said, "before I accepted God's."
  </p>
  <h2>
   "I CAN'T BELIEVE IN JESUS"
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   It was 1969. Lapides' curiosity prompted him to visit Sunset
  </p>
  <p>
   Strip to gawk at an evangelist who had chained himself to an
  </p>
  <p>
   eight-foot cross to protest the way local tavern owners had
  </p>
  <p>
   managed to get him evicted from his storefront ministry. There on
  </p>
  <p>
   the sidewalk Lapides encountered some Christians who engaged him
  </p>
  <p>
   in an impromptu spiritual debate. A bit cocky, he started
  </p>
  <p>
   throwing Eastern philosophy at them. "There is no God out there,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he said, gesturing toward the heavens. "We're God. I'm God.
  </p>
  <p>
   You're God. You just have to realize it." "Well, if you're God,
  </p>
  <p>
   why don't you create a rock?" one person replied. "Just make
  </p>
  <p>
   something appear. That's what God does." In his drug-addled mind
  </p>
  <p>
   Lapides imagined he was holding a rock. "Yeah, well, here's a
  </p>
  <p>
   rock," he said, extending his empty hand. The Christian scoffed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "That's the difference between you and the true God," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "When God creates something, everyone can see it. It's objective,
  </p>
  <p>
   not subjective."
  </p>
  <p>
   That registered with Lapides. After thinking about it for a
  </p>
  <p>
   while, he said to himself, If I find God, he's got to be
  </p>
  <p>
   objective. I'm through with this Eastern philosophy that says
  </p>
  <p>
   it's all in my mind and that I can create my own reality. God has
  </p>
  <p>
   to be an objective reality if he's going to have any meaning
  </p>
  <p>
   beyond my own imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
   When one of the Christians brought up the name of Jesus, Lapides
  </p>
  <p>
   tried to fend him off with his stock answer. "I'm Jewish," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said. "I can't believe in Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   A pastor spoke up. "Do you know of the prophecies about the
  </p>
  <p>
   Messiah?" he asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lapides was taken off guard. "Prophecies?" he said. "I've never
  </p>
  <p>
   heard of them."
  </p>
  <p>
   The minister startled Lapides by referring to some of the Old
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament  predictions. Wait a minute! Lapides thought. Those are
  </p>
  <p>
   my
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish Scriptures he's quoting! How could Jesus be in there? When
  </p>
  <p>
   the pastor offered him a Bible, Lapides was skeptical. "Is the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament in there?" he asked. The pastor nodded. "OK, I'll
  </p>
  <p>
   read the Old Testament, but I'm not going to open up the other
  </p>
  <p>
   one," Lapides told him.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was taken aback by the minister's response. "Fine," said the
  </p>
  <p>
   pastor. "Just read the Old Testament and ask the God of Abraham,
  </p>
  <p>
   Isaac, and Jacob-the God of Israel-to show you if Jesus is the
  </p>
  <p>
   Messiah. Because he is your Messiah. He came to the Jewish people
  </p>
  <p>
   initially, and then he was also the Savior of the world."
  </p>
  <p>
   To Lapides, this was new information. Intriguing information.
  </p>
  <p>
   Astonishing information. So he went back to his apartment, opened
  </p>
  <p>
   the Old Testament to its first book, Genesis, and went hunting
  </p>
  <p>
   for Jesus among words that had been written hundreds of years
  </p>
  <p>
   before the carpenter of Nazareth had ever been born.

   "PIERCED FOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS"
  </h2>
  <p>
   "Pretty soon," Lapides told me, "I was reading the Old Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   every day and seeing one prophecy after another. For instance,
  </p>
  <p>
   Deuteronomy talked about a prophet greater than Moses who will
  </p>
  <p>
   come and whom we should listen to. I thought, Who can be greater
  </p>
  <p>
   than Moses? It sounded like the Messiah-someone as great and as
  </p>
  <p>
   respected as Moses but a greater teacher and a greater authority.
  </p>
  <p>
   I grabbed ahold of that and went searching for him."
  </p>
  <p>
   As Lapides progressed through the Scriptures, he was stopped cold
  </p>
  <p>
   by Isaiah 53. With clarity and specificity, in a haunting
  </p>
  <p>
   prediction  wrapped in exquisite poetry, here was the picture of
  </p>
  <p>
   a Messiah who would suffer and die for the sins of Israel and the
  </p>
  <p>
   world-all written more than seven hundred years before Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   walked the earth. He was despised and rejected by men,
  </p>
  <p>
   a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
   Like one from whom men hide their faces
  </p>
  <p>
   he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
  </p>
  <p>
   Surely he took up our infirmities
  </p>
  <p>
   and carried our sorrows,
  </p>
  <p>
   yet we considered him stricken by God,
  </p>
  <p>
   smitten by him, and afflicted.
  </p>
  <p>
   But he was pierced for our transgressions,
  </p>
  <p>
   he was crushed for our iniquities;
  </p>
  <p>
   the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,
  </p>
  <p>
   and by his wounds we are healed.
  </p>
  <p>
   We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
  </p>
  <p>
   each of us has turned to his own way;
  </p>
  <p>
   and the LORD has laid on him
  </p>
  <p>
   the iniquity of us all.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was oppressed and afflicted,
  </p>
  <p>
   yet he did not open his mouth;
  </p>
  <p>
   he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
  </p>
  <p>
   and as a sheep before her shearers is silent,
  </p>
  <p>
   so he did not open his mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
   By oppression and judgment he was taken away.
  </p>
  <p>
   And who can speak of his descendants?
  </p>
  <p>
   For he was cut off from the land of the living;
  </p>
  <p>
   for the transgression of my people he was stricken.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was assigned a grave with the wicked,
  </p>
  <p>
   and with the rich in his death,
