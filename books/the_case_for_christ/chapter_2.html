  <h2>
   INTRODUCTION
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Reopening the Investigation of a Lifetime
  </p>
  <p>
   In the parlance of prosecutors, the attempted murder case against
  </p>
  <p>
   ames Dixon was "a dead-bang winner." Open and shut. Even a
  </p>
  <p>
   cursory examination of the evidence was enough to establish that
  </p>
  <p>
   Dixon shot police sergeant Richard Scanlon in the abdomen during
  </p>
  <p>
   a scuffle on Chicago's south side.
  </p>
  <p>
   Piece by piece, item by item, witness by witness, the evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   tightened a noose around Dixon's neck. There were fingerprints
  </p>
  <p>
   and a weapon, eyewitnesses and a motive, a wounded cop and a
  </p>
  <p>
   defendant  with a history of violence. Now the criminal justice
  </p>
  <p>
   system was poised to trip the trap door that would leave Dixon
  </p>
  <p>
   dangling by the weight of his own guilt.
  </p>
  <p>
   The facts were simple. Sergeant Scanlon had rushed to West
  </p>
  <p>
   108th Place after a neighbor called police to report a man with a
  </p>
  <p>
   gun. Scanlon arrived to find Dixon noisily arguing with his
  </p>
  <p>
   girlfriend through the front door of her house. Her father
  </p>
  <p>
   emerged when he saw Scanlon, figuring it was safe to come
  </p>
  <p>
   outside.
  </p>
  <p>
   Suddenly a fight broke out between Dixon and the father. The
  </p>
  <p>
   sergeant quickly intervened in an attempt to break it up. A shot
  </p>
  <p>
   rang out; Scanlon staggered away, wounded in his midsection. Just
  </p>
  <p>
   then two other squad cars arrived, screeching to a halt, and
  </p>
  <p>
   officers ran over to restrain Dixon.
  </p>
  <p>
   A .22-caliber gun belonging to Dixon-covered with his
  </p>
  <p>
   fingerprints  and with one bullet having been fired-was found
  </p>
  <p>
   nearby,
  </p>
  <p>
   where he had apparently flung it after the shooting. The father
  </p>
  <p>
   had been unarmed; Scanlon's revolver remained in his holster.
  </p>
  <p>
   Powder burns on Scanlon's skin showed that he had been shot at
  </p>
  <p>
   extremely close range.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fortunately, his wound wasn't life-threatening, although it was
  </p>
  <p>
   serious enough to earn him a medal for bravery, proudly pinned on
  </p>
  <p>
   his chest by the police superintendent himself. As for Dixon,
  </p>
  <p>
   when police ran his rap sheet, they found he had previously been
  </p>
  <p>
   convicted of shooting someone else. Apparently, he had a
  </p>
  <p>
   propensity for violence.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   And there I sat almost a year later, taking notes in a nearly
  </p>
  <p>
   deserted Chicago courtroom while Dixon publicly admitted that,
  </p>
  <p>
   yes, he was guilty of shooting the fifteen-year police veteran.
  </p>
  <p>
   On top of all the other evidence, the confession clinched it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Criminal court judge Frank Machala ordered Dixon imprisoned, then
  </p>
  <p>
   rapped his gavel to signal that the case was closed. Justice had
  </p>
  <p>
   been served.
  </p>
  <p>
   I slipped my notebook into the inside pocket of my sports coat
  </p>
  <p>
   and erupted downstairs toward the press room. At the most, I
  </p>
  <p>
   figured my editor would give me three paragraphs to tell the
  </p>
  <p>
   story in the next day's Chicago Tribune. Certainly, that's all it
  </p>
  <p>
   deserved. This wasn't much of a tale.
  </p>
  <p>
   Or so I thought.
  </p>
  <p>
   THE WHISPER OF AN INFORMANT
  </p>
  <p>
   I answered the phone in the pressroom and recognized the voice
  </p>
  <p>
   right away-it was an informant I had cultivated during the year I
  </p>
  <p>
   had been covering the criminal courts building. I could tell he
  </p>
  <p>
   had something  hot for me, because the bigger the tip, the faster
  </p>
  <p>
   and softer he would talk-and he was whispering a mile a minute.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Lee, do you know that Dixon case?" he asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yeah, sure," I replied. "Covered it two days ago. Pretty
  </p>
  <p>
   routine." "Don't be so sure. The word is that a few weeks before
  </p>
  <p>
   the shooting,  Sergeant Scanlon was at a party, showing off his
  </p>
  <p>
   pen gun." "His what?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "A pen gun. It's a .22-caliber pistol that's made to look like a
  </p>
  <p>
   fountain pen. They're illegal for anyone to carry, including
  </p>
  <p>
   cops." When I told him I didn't see the relevance of this, his
  </p>
  <p>
   voice got even more animated. "Here's the thing: Dixon didn't
  </p>
  <p>
   shoot Scanlon. Scanlon was wounded when his own pen gun
  </p>
  <p>
   accidentally went off in his shirt pocket. He framed Dixon so he
  </p>
  <p>
   wouldn't get in trouble for carrying an unauthorized weapon.
  </p>
  <p>
   Don't you see? Dixon is innocent!" "Impossible!" I exclaimed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Check out the evidence yourself," came his reply. "See where it
  </p>
  <p>
   really points."
  </p>
  <p>
   I hung up the phone and dashed up the stairs to the prosecutor's
  </p>
  <p>
   office, pausing briefly to catch my breath before strolling
  </p>
  <p>
   inside. "You know the Dixon case?" I asked casually, not wanting
  </p>
  <p>
   to tip my hand too early. "If you don't mind, I'd like to go over
  </p>
  <p>
   the details once more."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Color drained from his face. "Uh, I can't talk about it," be
  </p>
  <p>
   stammered.  "No comment."
  </p>
  <p>
   It turned out that my informant had already passed along his
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicions  to the prosecutor's office. Behind the scenes, a
  </p>
  <p>
   grand jury was being convened to reconsider the evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   Amazingly, unexpectedly, the once airtight case against James
  </p>
  <p>
   Dixon was being reopened. NEW FACTS FOR A NEW THEORY
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, I started my own investigation, studying the
  </p>
  <p>
   crime scene, interviewing witnesses, talking with Dixon, and
  </p>
  <p>
   examining the physical evidence. As I thoroughly checked out the
  </p>
  <p>
   case, the strangest thing happened: all the new facts that I
  </p>
  <p>
   uncovered-and even the old evidence that had once pointed so
  </p>
  <p>
   convincingly toward Dixon's guilt-snugly fit the pen gun theory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Witnesses said that before Scanlon arrived on the scene, Dixon
  </p>
  <p>
   had been pounding his gun on the door of his girlfriend's
  </p>
  <p>
   house. The gun discharged in a downward direction; in the
  </p>
  <p>
   cement of the front porch there was a chip that was consistent
  </p>
  <p>
   with a bullet's impact. This would account for the bullet that
  </p>
  <p>
   was missing from Dixon's gun.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dixon said he didn't want to be caught with a gun, so he hid it
  </p>
  <p>
   in some grass across the street before police arrived. I found a
  </p>
  <p>
   witness who corroborated that. This explained why the gun had
  </p>
  <p>
   been found some distance from the shooting scene even
  </p>
  <p>
   though nobody had ever seen Dixon throw it.
  </p>
  <p>
   There were powder burns concentrated inside-but not
  </p>
  <p>
   above-the left pocket of Scanlon's shirt. The bullet bole was at
  </p>
  <p>
   the bottom of the pocket. Conclusion: a weapon had somehow
  </p>
  <p>
   discharged in the pocket's interior.
  </p>
  <p>
   Contrary to statements in the police report, the bullet's
  </p>
  <p>
   trajectory  had been at a downward angle. Below Scanlon's shirt
  </p>
  <p>
   pocket was a bloody rip where the bullet had exited after going
  </p>
  <p>
   through some flesh.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dixon's rap sheet hadn't told the whole story about him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although he had spent three years in prison for an earlier
  </p>
  <p>
   shooting, the appellate court had freed him after determining
  </p>
  <p>
   that he had been wrongly convicted. It turns out that police had
  </p>
  <p>
   concealed a key defense witness and that a prosecution
  </p>
  <p>
   witness had lied. So much for Dixon's record of violent
  </p>
  <p>
   tendencies.
  </p>
  <h2>
   AN INNOCENT MAN IS FREED
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Finally I put the crucial question to Dixon: "If you were
  </p>
  <p>
   innocent, why in the world did you plead guilty?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Dixon sighed. "It was a plea bargain," he said, referring to the
  </p>
  <p>
   practice in which prosecutors recommend a reduced sentence if a
  </p>
  <p>
   defendant pleads guilty and thus saves everybody the time and
  </p>
  <p>
   expense of a trial.
  </p>
  <p>
   "They said if I pleaded guilty, they would sentence me to one
  </p>
  <p>
   year in prison. I'd already spent 362 days in jail waiting for my
  </p>
  <p>
   trial. All I had to do was admit I did it and I'd go home in a
  </p>
  <p>
   few days. But if I insisted on a trial and the jury found me
  </p>
  <p>
   guilty-well, they'd throw the book at me. They'd give me twenty
  </p>
  <p>
   years for shooting a cop. It wasn't worth the gamble. I wanted to
  </p>
  <p>
   go home...."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And so," I said, "you admitted doing something that you didn't
  </p>
  <p>
   do." Dixon nodded. "That's right."
  </p>
  <p>
   In the end Dixon was exonerated, and he later won a lawsuit
  </p>
  <p>
   against the police department. Scanlon was stripped of his medal,
  </p>
  <p>
   was indicted by a grand jury, pleaded guilty to official
  </p>
  <p>
   misconduct, and was fired from the department. As for me, my
  </p>
  <p>
   stories were splashed across the front page. Much more important,
  </p>
  <p>
   I had learned some big lessons as a young reporter.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the most obvious lessons was that evidence can be aligned
  </p>
  <p>
   to point in more than one direction. For example, there had
  </p>
  <p>
   easily been enough proof to convict Dixon of shooting the
  </p>
  <p>
   sergeant. But the key questions were these: Had the collection of
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence really been thorough? And which explanation best fit the
  </p>
  <p>
   totality of the facts? Once the pen gun theory was offered, it
  </p>
  <p>
   became clear that this scenario  accounted for the full body of
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence in the most optimal way. And there was another lesson.
  </p>
  <p>
   One reason the evidence originally looked so convincing to me was
  </p>
  <p>
   because it fit my preconceptions at the time. To me, Dixon was an
  </p>
  <p>
   obvious troublemaker, a failure, the unemployed product of a
  </p>
  <p>
   broken family. The cops were the good guys. Prosecutors didn't
  </p>
  <p>
   make mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking through those lenses, all the original evidence seemed to
  </p>
  <p>
   fall neatly into place. Where there had been inconsistencies or
  </p>
  <p>
   gaps,
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I naively glossed them over. When police told me the case was
  </p>
  <p>
   airtight,  I took them at their word and didn't delve much
  </p>
  <p>
   further.
  </p>
  <p>
   But when I changed those lenses-trading my biases for an
  </p>
  <p>
   attempt at objectivity-I saw the case in a whole new light.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally I allowed the evidence to lead me to the truth,
  </p>
  <p>
   regardless of whether it fit my original presuppositions.
  </p>
  <p>
   That was more than twenty years ago. My biggest lessons were yet
  </p>
  <p>
   to come.

  <h2>
   FROM DIXON TO JESUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The reason I've recounted this unusual case is because in a way
  </p>
  <p>
   my spiritual journey has been a lot like my experience with James
  </p>
  <p>
   Dixon. For much of my life I was a skeptic. In fact, I considered
  </p>
  <p>
   myself an atheist. To me, there was far too much evidence that
  </p>
  <p>
   God was merely a product of wishful thinking, of ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   mythology, of primitive  superstition. How could there be a
  </p>
  <p>
   loving God if he consigned people to hell just for not believing
  </p>
  <p>
   in him? How could miracles contravene  the basic laws of nature?
  </p>
  <p>
   Didn't evolution satisfactorily
  </p>
  <p>
   explain how life originated? Doesn't scientific reasoning dispel
  </p>
  <p>
   belief in the supernatural?
  </p>
  <p>
   As for Jesus, didn't you know that he never claimed to be God? He
  </p>
  <p>
   was a revolutionary, a sage, an iconoclastic Jew-but God? No,
  </p>
  <p>
   that thought never occurred to him! I could point you to plenty
  </p>
  <p>
   of university  professors who said so-and certainly they could be
  </p>
  <p>
   trusted, couldn't they? Let's face it: even a cursory examination
  </p>
  <p>
   of the evidence  demonstrates convincingly that Jesus had only
  </p>
  <p>
   been a human being just like you and me, although with unusual
  </p>
  <p>
   gifts of kindness and wisdom.
  </p>
  <p>
   But that's all I had ever really given the evidence: a cursory
  </p>
  <p>
   look. I had read just enough philosophy and history to find
  </p>
  <p>
   support for my skepticism-a fact here, a scientific theory there,
  </p>
  <p>
   a pithy quote, a clever argument. Sure, I could see some gaps and
  </p>
  <p>
   inconsistencies, but I had a strong motivation to ignore them: a
  </p>
  <p>
   self-serving and immoral lifestyle that I would be compelled to
