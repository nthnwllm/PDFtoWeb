  <p>
   and the amazing emergence  and growth of the church.
  </p>
  <p>
   Given all five uncontested facts, I had to agree with Moreland
  </p>
  <p>
   that the Resurrection, and only the Resurrection, makes sense of
  </p>
  <p>
   them all. No other explanation comes close. And that's just the
  </p>
  <p>
   indirect  evidence. When I added the potent proof for the empty
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb of Jesus, and the convincing testimony about his post-
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection appearances, the case seemed conclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
   That was also the assessment of Sir Lionel Luckhoo, the brilliant
  </p>
  <p>
   and savvy attorney whose astounding 245 consecutive murder
  </p>
  <p>
   acquittals  earned him a place in The Guinness Book of World
  </p>
  <p>
   Records as the world's most successful lawyer.  Knighted twice by
  </p>
  <p>
   Queen Elizabeth, this former justice and diplomat subjected the
  </p>
  <p>
   historical facts about the Resurrection to his own rigorous
  </p>
  <p>
   analysis for several years before declaring, "I say unequivocally
  </p>
  <p>
   that the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ is so
  </p>
  <p>
   overwhelming that it compels acceptance by proof which leaves
  </p>
  <p>
   absolutely no room for doubt."
  </p>
  <p>
   But wait. There is more.
  </p>
  <h2>
   TAKING THE FINAL STEP
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Our interview over, Moreland and I were bantering about football
  </p>
  <p>
   as I unplugged my tape recorder and began packing away my notes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though I was in a bit of a hurry to catch my flight back to
  </p>
  <p>
   Chicago, he said something that prompted me to pause.
  </p>
  <p>
   "There's one other category of evidence you haven't asked about,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he remarked.
  </p>
  <p>
   My mind reviewed our interview. "I give up," I said. "What is
  </p>
  <p>
   it?" "It's the ongoing encounter with the resurrected Christ that
  </p>
  <p>
   happens  all over the world, in every culture, to people from all
  </p>
  <p>
   kinds of backgrounds and personalities -well educated and not,
  </p>
  <p>
   rich and poor, thinkers and feelers, men and women," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "They all will testify that more than any single thing in their
  </p>
  <p>
   lives, Jesus Christ has Changed them."
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreland leaned forward for emphasis. "To me, this provides the
  </p>
  <p>
   final evidence-not the only evidence but the final confirming
  </p>
  <p>
   proof-that the message of Jesus can open the door to a direct
  </p>
  <p>
   encounter with the risen Christ."
  </p>
  <p>
   assume you've had an encounter like that," I said. "Tell me about
  </p>
  <p>
   it."
  </p>
  <p>
   "In 1968 I was a cynical chemistry major at the University of
  </p>
  <p>
   Missouri, when I was confronted with the fact that if I examined
  </p>
  <p>
   the claims of Jesus Christ critically but with an open mind,
  </p>
  <p>
   there was more than enough evidence for me to believe it.
  </p>
  <p>
   So I took a step of faith in the same direction the evidence was
  </p>
  <p>
   pointing, by receiving Jesus as my forgiver and leader, and I
  </p>
  <p>
   began to relate to him-to the resurrected Christ-in a very real
  </p>
  <p>
   and ongoing  way.
  </p>
  <p>
   In three decades I've had hundreds of specific answers to
  </p>
  <p>
   prayers, I've had things happen that simply cannot be explained
  </p>
  <p>
   by natural explanations, and I have experienced a changed life
  </p>
  <p>
   beyond anything I could have imagined."
  </p>
  <p>
   But, I protested, people experience life change in other
  </p>
  <p>
   religions whose tenets contradict Christianity. "Isn't it
  </p>
  <p>
   dangerous to base a decision on subjective experiences?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me make two things clear," he said. "First, I'm not saying,
  </p>
  <p>
   'Just trust your experience.' I'm saying, 'Use your mind calmly
  </p>
  <p>
   and weigh the evidence, and then let experience be a confirming
  </p>
  <p>
   piece of evidence.' Second, if what this evidence points to is
  </p>
  <p>
   true-that is, if all these lines of evidence really do point to
  </p>
  <p>
   the resurrection of Jesus-the evidence itself begs for an
  </p>
  <p>
   experiential test."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Define that," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   The experiential test is, 'He's still alive, and I can find out
  </p>
  <p>
   by relating to him.' If you were on a jury and heard enough
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence to convince you of someone's guilt, it wouldn't make
  </p>
  <p>
   sense to stop short of the final step of convicting him. And for
  </p>
  <p>
   people to accept the evidence  for the resurrection of Jesus and
  </p>
  <p>
   not take the final step of testing  it experientially would be to
  </p>
  <p>
   miss where the evidence is ultimately pointing."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So," I said, "if the evidence points strongly in this direction,
  </p>
  <p>
   it's only rational and logical to follow it into the experiential
  </p>
  <p>
   realm." He nodded in approval. "That's precisely right," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It's the final confirmation of the evidence. In fact, I'll say
  </p>
  <p>
   this: the evidence screams out for the experiential test."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <p>
   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  The disciples were in the unique position of knowing for
  </p>
  <p>
   certain whether Jesus had returned from the dead, and they were
  </p>
  <p>
   willing to die for their conviction that he did. Can you think of
  </p>
  <p>
   anyone in history who has knowingly and willingly died for a lie?
  </p>
  <p>
   What degree of certainty would you need before you would be
  </p>
  <p>
   willing to lay down your life for a belief? How thoroughly would
  </p>
  <p>
   you investigate  a matter if you were going to base your life on
  </p>
  <p>
   it?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  What are your most cherished beliefs? What would it take for
  </p>
  <p>
   you to abandon or radically rethink those treasured opinions-
  </p>
  <p>
   especially  if you truly believed you were risking the damnation
  </p>
  <p>
   of your soul if you were wrong? How does your answer relate to
  </p>
  <p>
   the historical  fact that thousands of Jews suddenly abandoned
  </p>
  <p>
   five key
  </p>
  <p>
   social and religious structures shortly after the crucifixion of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus? 3.  Other than the resurrection of Jesus, can you think of
  </p>
  <p>
   any explanation  that would simultaneously account for all five
  </p>
  <p>
   categories of evidence that J. P. Moreland discussed? How do you
  </p>
  <p>
   think someone  like him would respond to your hypothesis?
  </p>
  <p>
   4.  Moreland ended his interview by talking about the
  </p>
  <p>
   experiential test. What would have to happen before you would be
  </p>
  <p>
   willing to take that step yourself?

   CONCLUSION:
  </h2>
  <h2>
   THE VERDICT OF HISTORY
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   What Does the Evidence Establish And  What Does It Mean Today?
  </p>
  <p>
   The date was November 8, 1981. It was a Sunday. I locked myself
  </p>
  <p>
   in my home office and spent the afternoon replaying the spiritual
  </p>
  <p>
   journey I had been traveling for twenty-one months.
  </p>
  <p>
   My investigation into Jesus was similar to what you've just read,
  </p>
  <p>
   except that I primarily studied books and other historical
  </p>
  <p>
   research instead of personally interacting with scholars. I had
  </p>
  <p>
   asked questions and analyzed answers with as much of an open mind
  </p>
  <p>
   as I could muster. Now I had reached critical mass. The evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   was clear. The one remaining issue was what I would do with it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pulling out a legal pad, I began listing the questions I had
  </p>
  <p>
   posed as I embarked on my investigation, and some of the key
  </p>
  <p>
   facts I had uncovered. In a similar way, I could sum up the
  </p>
  <p>
   substance of what we've learned in our own examination of the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence.
  </p>
  <h2>
   CAN THE BIOGRAPHIES OF JESUS BE TRUSTED?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I once thought the gospels were merely religious propaganda,
  </p>
  <p>
   hopelessly  tainted by overactive imaginations and evangelistic
  </p>
  <p>
   zeal. However,  Craig Blomberg, one of the country's foremost
  </p>
  <p>
   authorities on the topic, built a convincing case that they
  </p>
  <p>
   reflect eyewitness testimony and bear the unmistakable earmarks
  </p>
  <p>
   of accuracy. So early are these biographies that they cannot be
  </p>
  <p>
   explained away as legendary invention.  In fact, the fundamental
  </p>
  <p>
   beliefs in Jesus' miracles, resurrection, and deity go way back
  </p>
  <p>
   to the very dawning of the Christian movement.
  </p>
  <h2>
   DO THE BIOGRAPHIES OF JESUS STAND UP TO SCRUTINY?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Blomberg argued persuasively that the gospel writers intended to
  </p>
  <p>
   preserve  reliable history, were able to do so, were honest and
  </p>
  <p>
   willing to include difficult-to-explain material, and didn't
  </p>
  <p>
   allow bias to unduly color their reporting. The harmony among the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels on essential facts, coupled with divergence on some
  </p>
  <p>
   details, lends historical credibility  to the accounts. What's
  </p>
  <p>
   more, the early church couldn't have taken root and flourished
  </p>
  <p>
   right there in Jerusalem if it had been teaching  facts about
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus that his own contemporaries could have exposed as
  </p>
  <p>
   exaggerated or false. In short, the gospels were able to pass all
  </p>
  <p>
   eight evidential tests.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WERE JESUS' BIOGRAPHIES RELIABLY PRESERVED FOR US?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   World-class scholar Bruce Metzger said that compared with other
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient documents, there is an unprecedented number of New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament  manuscripts and that they can be dated extremely close
  </p>
  <p>
   to the original writings. The modern New Testament is 99.5
  </p>
  <p>
   percent free of textual discrepancies, with no major Christian
  </p>
  <p>
   doctrines in doubt. The criteria used by the early church to
  </p>
  <p>
   determine which books should be considered authoritative have
  </p>
  <p>
   ensured that we possess the best records about Jesus.

   founder of any other ancient religion," said Edwin Yamauchi.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sources from outside  the Bible corroborate that many people
  </p>
  <p>
   believed Jesus performed healings and was the Messiah, that he
  </p>
  <p>
   was crucified, and that despite this shameful death, his
  </p>
  <p>
   followers, who believed he was still alive, worshiped  him as
  </p>
  <p>
   God. One expert documented thirty-nine ancient sources that
  </p>
  <p>
   corroborate more than one hundred facts concerning Jesus' life,
  </p>
  <p>
   teachings, crucifixion, and resurrection. Seven secular sources
  </p>
  <p>
   and several  early creeds concern the deity of Jesus, a doctrine
  </p>
  <p>
   "definitely present  in the earliest church," according to
  </p>
  <p>
   scholar Gary Habermas.

  <h2>
   DOES ARCHAEOLOGY CONFIRM OR CONTRADICT
  </h2>
  <h2>
   JESUS' BIOGRAPHIES?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Archaeologist John MeRay mid there's no question that
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeological findings have enhanced the New Testament's
  </p>
  <p>
   credibility. No discovery has ever disproved a biblical
  </p>
  <p>
   reference. Further, archaeology has established  that Luke, who
  </p>
  <p>
   wrote about one-quarter of the New Testament, was an especially
  </p>
  <p>
   careful historian. Concluded one expert, "If Luke was so
  </p>
  <p>
   painstakingly accurate in his historical reporting [of minor
  </p>
  <p>
   details], on what logical basis may we assume he was credulous or
  </p>
  <p>
   inaccurate in his reporting of matters that were far more
  </p>
  <p>
   important, not only to him but to others as well?" Like, for
  </p>
  <p>
   instance, the resurrection of Jesus.

  <h2>
   IS THE JESUS OF HISTORY THE SAME AS THE JESUS OF FAITH?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Gregory Boyd said the much-publicized Jesus Seminar, which doubts
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus said most of what's attributed to him, represents "an
  </p>
  <p>
   extremely small number of radical-fringe scholars who are on the
  </p>
  <p>
   far, far left wing of New Testament thinking." The Seminar ruled
  </p>
  <p>
   out the possibility  of miracles at the outset, it employed
  </p>
  <p>
   questionable criteria, and some participants have touted myth-
  </p>
  <p>
   riddled documents of extremely dubious quality. Further, the idea
  </p>
  <p>
   that stories about Jesus emerged from mythology about gods dying
  </p>
  <p>
   and rising fails to withstand scrutiny. Said Boyd, "The evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   for Jesus being who the disciples said he was ... is just light-
  </p>
  <p>
   years beyond my reasons for thinking that the left-wing
