   and the amazing emergence  and growth of the church. Given all five uncontested facts, I had to agree with Moreland that the Resurrection, and only the Resurrection, makes sense of them all. No other explanation comes close. And that's just the indirect  evidence. When I added the potent proof for the empty tomb of Jesus, and the convincing testimony about his post- Resurrection appearances, the case seemed conclusive. That was also the assessment of Sir Lionel Luckhoo, the brilliant and savvy attorney whose astounding 245 consecutive murder acquittals  earned him a place in The Guinness Book of World Records as the world's most successful lawyer.  Knighted twice by Queen Elizabeth, this former justice and diplomat subjected the historical facts about the Resurrection to his own rigorous analysis for several years before declaring, "I say unequivocally that the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it compels acceptance by proof which leaves absolutely no room for doubt." But wait. There is more.
  </p>
  <h2>
   TAKING THE FINAL STEP
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Our interview over, Moreland and I were bantering about football as I unplugged my tape recorder and began packing away my notes. Though I was in a bit of a hurry to catch my flight back to Chicago, he said something that prompted me to pause. "There's one other category of evidence you haven't asked about," he remarked. My mind reviewed our interview. "I give up," I said. "What is it?" "It's the ongoing encounter with the resurrected Christ that happens  all over the world, in every culture, to people from all kinds of backgrounds and personalities -well educated and not, rich and poor, thinkers and feelers, men and women," he said. "They all will testify that more than any single thing in their lives, Jesus Christ has Changed them." Moreland leaned forward for emphasis. "To me, this provides the final evidence-not the only evidence but the final confirming proof-that the message of Jesus can open the door to a direct encounter with the risen Christ." assume you've had an encounter like that," I said. "Tell me about it." "In 1968 I was a cynical chemistry major at the University of Missouri, when I was confronted with the fact that if I examined the claims of Jesus Christ critically but with an open mind, there was more than enough evidence for me to believe it. So I took a step of faith in the same direction the evidence was pointing, by receiving Jesus as my forgiver and leader, and I began to relate to him-to the resurrected Christ-in a very real and ongoing  way. In three decades I've had hundreds of specific answers to prayers, I've had things happen that simply cannot be explained by natural explanations, and I have experienced a changed life beyond anything I could have imagined." But, I protested, people experience life change in other religions whose tenets contradict Christianity. "Isn't it dangerous to base a decision on subjective experiences?" I asked. "Let me make two things clear," he said. "First, I'm not saying, 'Just trust your experience.' I'm saying, 'Use your mind calmly and weigh the evidence, and then let experience be a confirming piece of evidence.' Second, if what this evidence points to is true-that is, if all these lines of evidence really do point to the resurrection of Jesus-the evidence itself begs for an experiential test." "Define that," I said. The experiential test is, 'He's still alive, and I can find out by relating to him.' If you were on a jury and heard enough evidence to convince you of someone's guilt, it wouldn't make sense to stop short of the final step of convicting him. And for people to accept the evidence  for the resurrection of Jesus and not take the final step of testing  it experientially would be to miss where the evidence is ultimately pointing." "So," I said, "if the evidence points strongly in this direction, it's only rational and logical to follow it into the experiential realm." He nodded in approval. "That's precisely right," he said. "It's the final confirmation of the evidence. In fact, I'll say this: the evidence screams out for the experiential test."

  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations Questions for Reflection or Group Study 1.  The disciples were in the unique position of knowing for certain whether Jesus had returned from the dead, and they were willing to die for their conviction that he did. Can you think of anyone in history who has knowingly and willingly died for a lie? What degree of certainty would you need before you would be willing to lay down your life for a belief? How thoroughly would you investigate  a matter if you were going to base your life on it? 2.  What are your most cherished beliefs? What would it take for you to abandon or radically rethink those treasured opinions- especially  if you truly believed you were risking the damnation of your soul if you were wrong? How does your answer relate to the historical  fact that thousands of Jews suddenly abandoned five key social and religious structures shortly after the crucifixion of Jesus? 3.  Other than the resurrection of Jesus, can you think of any explanation  that would simultaneously account for all five categories of evidence that J. P. Moreland discussed? How do you think someone  like him would respond to your hypothesis? 4.  Moreland ended his interview by talking about the experiential test. What would have to happen before you would be willing to take that step yourself?

   CONCLUSION:
  </h2>
  <h2>
   THE VERDICT OF HISTORY
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   What Does the Evidence Establish And  What Does It Mean Today? The date was November 8, 1981. It was a Sunday. I locked myself in my home office and spent the afternoon replaying the spiritual journey I had been traveling for twenty-one months. My investigation into Jesus was similar to what you've just read, except that I primarily studied books and other historical research instead of personally interacting with scholars. I had asked questions and analyzed answers with as much of an open mind as I could muster. Now I had reached critical mass. The evidence was clear. The one remaining issue was what I would do with it. Pulling out a legal pad, I began listing the questions I had posed as I embarked on my investigation, and some of the key facts I had uncovered. In a similar way, I could sum up the substance of what we've learned in our own examination of the evidence.

  <h2>
   CAN THE BIOGRAPHIES OF JESUS BE TRUSTED?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I once thought the gospels were merely religious propaganda, hopelessly  tainted by overactive imaginations and evangelistic zeal. However,  Craig Blomberg, one of the country's foremost authorities on the topic, built a convincing case that they reflect eyewitness testimony and bear the unmistakable earmarks of accuracy. So early are these biographies that they cannot be explained away as legendary invention.  In fact, the fundamental beliefs in Jesus' miracles, resurrection, and deity go way back to the very dawning of the Christian movement.
  </p>
  <h2>
   DO THE BIOGRAPHIES OF JESUS STAND UP TO SCRUTINY?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Blomberg argued persuasively that the gospel writers intended to preserve  reliable history, were able to do so, were honest and willing to include difficult-to-explain material, and didn't allow bias to unduly color their reporting. The harmony among the gospels on essential facts, coupled with divergence on some details, lends historical credibility  to the accounts. What's more, the early church couldn't have taken root and flourished right there in Jerusalem if it had been teaching  facts about Jesus that his own contemporaries could have exposed as exaggerated or false. In short, the gospels were able to pass all eight evidential tests.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WERE JESUS' BIOGRAPHIES RELIABLY PRESERVED FOR US?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   World-class scholar Bruce Metzger said that compared with other ancient documents, there is an unprecedented number of New Testament  manuscripts and that they can be dated extremely close to the original writings. The modern New Testament is 99.5 percent free of textual discrepancies, with no major Christian doctrines in doubt. The criteria used by the early church to determine which books should be considered authoritative have ensured that we possess the best records about Jesus.
  </p>
  <h2>
   IS THERE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE FOR JESUS OUTSIDE HIS
  </h2>
  <h2>
   BIOGRAPHIES?
  </h2>
  <p>
   "We have better historical documentation for Jesus than for the founder of any other ancient religion," said Edwin Yamauchi. Sources from outside  the Bible corroborate that many people believed Jesus performed healings and was the Messiah, that he was crucified, and that despite this shameful death, his followers, who believed he was still alive, worshiped  him as God. One expert documented thirty-nine ancient sources that corroborate more than one hundred facts concerning Jesus' life, teachings, crucifixion, and resurrection. Seven secular sources and several  early creeds concern the deity of Jesus, a doctrine "definitely present  in the earliest church," according to scholar Gary Habermas.

  <h2>
   DOES ARCHAEOLOGY CONFIRM OR CONTRADICT
  </h2>
  <h2>
   JESUS' BIOGRAPHIES?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Archaeologist John MeRay mid there's no question that archaeological findings have enhanced the New Testament's credibility. No discovery has ever disproved a biblical reference. Further, archaeology has established  that Luke, who wrote about one-quarter of the New Testament, was an especially careful historian. Concluded one expert, "If Luke was so painstakingly accurate in his historical reporting [of minor details], on what logical basis may we assume he was credulous or inaccurate in his reporting of matters that were far more important, not only to him but to others as well?" Like, for instance, the resurrection of Jesus.

   IS THE JESUS OF HISTORY THE SAME AS THE JESUS OF FAITH?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Gregory Boyd said the much-publicized Jesus Seminar, which doubts Jesus said most of what's attributed to him, represents "an extremely small number of radical-fringe scholars who are on the far, far left wing of New Testament thinking." The Seminar ruled out the possibility  of miracles at the outset, it employed questionable criteria, and some participants have touted myth- riddled documents of extremely dubious quality. Further, the idea that stories about Jesus emerged from mythology about gods dying and rising fails to withstand scrutiny. Said Boyd, "The evidence for Jesus being who the disciples said he was ... is just light- years beyond my reasons for thinking that the left-wing
