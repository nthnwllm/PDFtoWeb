  <p>
   us the full story about Jesus?
  </p>
  <p>
   I looked at my watch. If traffic was light, I'd make my plane
  </p>
  <p>
   back to Chicago. As I gathered my notes and unplugged my
  </p>
  <p>
   recording equipment, I happened to glance once more at the
  </p>
  <p>
   children's paintings  on Blomberg's wall-and suddenly for a
  </p>
  <p>
   moment I thought of
  </p>
  <p>
   him not as a scholar, not as an author, not as a professor, but
  </p>
  <p>
   as a father who sits on the edge of his daughters' beds at night
  </p>
  <p>
   and speaks quietly to them about what's really important in life.
  </p>
  <p>
   What does he tell them, I wondered, about the Bible, about God,
  </p>
  <p>
   about this Jesus who makes such outrageous claims about himself?
  </p>
  <p>
   I couldn't resist one last line of questions. "What about your
  </p>
  <p>
   own faith?" I asked. "How has all your research affected your
  </p>
  <p>
   beliefs?" I barely got the words out of my mouth before he
  </p>
  <p>
   replied. "It has strengthened them, no question. I know from my
  </p>
  <p>
   own research that there's very strong evidence for the
  </p>
  <p>
   trustworthiness of the gospel accounts."
  </p>
  <p>
   He was quiet for a moment, then continued. "You know, it's
  </p>
  <p>
   ironic: The Bible considers it praiseworthy to have a faith that
  </p>
  <p>
   does not require evidence. Remember how Jesus replied to doubting
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomas: 'You believe because you see; blessed are those who have
  </p>
  <p>
   not seen and yet believe.' And I know evidence can never compel
  </p>
  <p>
   or coerce faith. We cannot supplant the role of the Holy Spirit,
  </p>
  <p>
   which is often a concern of Christians when they hear discussions
  </p>
  <p>
   of this kind.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I'll tell you this: there are plenty of stories of scholars in
  </p>
  <p>
   the New Testament field who have not been Christians, yet through
  </p>
  <p>
   their studying of these very issues have come to faith in Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
   And there have been countless more scholars, already believers,
  </p>
  <p>
   whose faith has been made stronger, more solid, more grounded,
  </p>
  <p>
   because of the evidence and  that's the category I fall into."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   As for me, I had originally been in the first category-no, not a
  </p>
  <p>
   scholar but a skeptic, an iconoclast, a hard-nosed reporter on a
  </p>
  <p>
   quest for the truth about this Jesus who said he was the Way and
  </p>
  <p>
   the Truth and the Life.
  </p>
  <p>
   I clicked my briefcase closed and stood to thank Blomberg. I
  </p>
  <p>
   would fly back to Chicago satisfied that once again my spiritual
  </p>
  <p>
   quest was off to a good start.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Questions forReflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  Overall, how have Blomberg's responses to these eight
  </p>
  <p>
   evidential tests affected your confidence in the reliability of
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospels? Why?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  Which of these eight tests do you consider the most
  </p>
  <p>
   persuasive and why?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.  When people you trust give slightly different details of the
  </p>
  <p>
   same event, do you automatically doubt their credibility, or do
  </p>
  <p>
   you see if there's a reasonable way to reconcile their accounts?
  </p>
  <p>
   How convincing  did you find Blomberg's analysis of the apparent
  </p>
  <p>
   contradictions  among the gospels?

  <h2>
   3: THE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Were Jesus' Biographies Reliably Preserved for Us?
  </p>
  <p>
   As a reporter at the Chicago Tribune, I was a "document rat"-I
  </p>
  <p>
   spent countless hours rummaging through court files and sniffing
  </p>
  <p>
   for tidbits of news. It was painstaking and time consuming, but
  </p>
  <p>
   the rewards were worth it. I managed to scoop the competition
  </p>
  <p>
   with front page  stories on a regular basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, I once stumbled upon some top-secret grand jury
  </p>
  <p>
   transcripts that had inadvertently been put in a public file. My
  </p>
  <p>
   subsequent  articles exposed massive bid-rigging behind some of
  </p>
  <p>
   Chicago's biggest public works projects, including the
  </p>
  <p>
   construction of major expressways.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the most eye-popping cache of documents I ever uncovered came
  </p>
  <p>
   in a landmark case in which Ford Motor Company was charged with
  </p>
  <p>
   reckless homicide for the fiery deaths of three teenagers in a
  </p>
  <p>
   subcompact Pinto. It was the first time a U.S. manufacturer had
  </p>
  <p>
   been criminally charged for allegedly marketing a dangerous
  </p>
  <p>
   product. When I checked the court file in tiny Winamac, Indiana,
  </p>
  <p>
   I found scores of confidential Ford memos revealing that the
  </p>
  <p>
   automaker knew in advance that the Pinto could explode when
  </p>
  <p>
   struck from behind at about twenty miles an hour. The documents
  </p>
  <p>
   indicated that the automaker decided against improving the car's
  </p>
  <p>
   safety to save a few dollars per vehicle and to increase its
  </p>
  <p>
   luggage space.
  </p>
  <p>
   A Ford lawyer, who happened to be strolling through the
  </p>
  <p>
   courthouse,  spotted me making photocopies of the documents.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frantically he rushed into court to get a judicial order sealing
  </p>
  <p>
   the file from the Public's view.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   But it was too late. My story, headlined "Ford Ignored Pinto
  </p>
  <p>
   Fire, Peril, Secret Memos Show," was bannered in the Tribune and
  </p>
  <p>
   then flashed throughout the country.
  </p>
  <h2>
   AUTHENTICATING THE DOCUMENTS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Obtaining secret corporate memos is one thing; verifying their
  </p>
  <p>
   authenticity is another. Before a journalist can publish their
  </p>
  <p>
   contents or a prosecutor can admit the documents as evidence in a
  </p>
  <p>
   trial, steps must be taken to make sure they're genuine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Concerning the so-called Pinto papers, could the Ford letterheads
  </p>
  <p>
   on which they were written be counterfeits? Could the signatures
  </p>
  <p>
   be forgeries? How could I know for sure? And since the memos had
  </p>
  <p>
   obviously  been photocopied numerous times, how could I be
  </p>
  <p>
   confident
  </p>
  <p>
   that their contents hadn't been tampered with? In other words,
  </p>
  <p>
   how could I be certain that each copied document was identical to
  </p>
  <p>
   the original memo, which I didn't possess?
  </p>
  <p>
   What's more, how could I be positive that these memos told the
  </p>
  <p>
   whole story? After all, they represented just a small fraction of
  </p>
  <p>
   the internal correspondence at Ford. What if there were other
  </p>
  <p>
   memos, still hidden from the public's view, that would shed a
  </p>
  <p>
   whole different light on the matter if they were revealed?
  </p>
  <p>
   These are significant questions, and they're equally relevant in
  </p>
  <p>
   examining the New Testament. When I hold a Bible in my hands,
  </p>
  <p>
   essentially I'm holding copies of ancient historical records. The
  </p>
  <p>
   original  manuscripts of the biographies of Jesus-Matthew, Mark,
  </p>
  <p>
   Luke, and John-and all the other books of the Old and New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testaments have long ago crumbled into dust. So how can I be sure
  </p>
  <p>
   that these modern-day  versions-the end product of countless
  </p>
  <p>
   copying throughout
  </p>
  <p>
   the ages-bear any resemblance to what the authors originally
  </p>
  <p>
   wrote? In addition, how can I tell if these four biographies are
  </p>
  <p>
   telling the whole story? What if there were other biographies of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus that have been censored because the early church didn't
  </p>
  <p>
   like the image of Jesus they portrayed? How could I have
  </p>
  <p>
   confidence that church politics haven't squelched biographies of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus that were every bit as accurate  as the four that were
  </p>
  <p>
   finally included in the New Testament, and that would shed
  </p>
  <p>
   important new light on the words and deeds of this controversial
  </p>
  <p>
   carpenter from Nazareth?
  </p>
  <p>
   These two issues-whether Jesus' biographies were reliably
  </p>
  <p>
   preserved  for us and whether equally accurate biographies have
  </p>
  <p>
   been
  </p>
  <p>
   suppressed by the church-merited careful consideration. I knew
  </p>
  <p>
   that there was one scholar universally recognized as a leading
  </p>
  <p>
   authority  on these matters. I flew to Newark and drove a rental
  </p>
  <p>
   car to Princeton  to visit him on short notice.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE SECOND INTERVIEW BRUCE M. METZGEI PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I found eighty-four-year-old Bruce Metzger on a Saturday
  </p>
  <p>
   afternoon at his usual hangout, the library at Princeton
  </p>
  <p>
   Theological Seminary, where, he says with a smile, "I like to
  </p>
  <p>
   dust off the books." Actually, he has written some of the best of
  </p>
  <p>
   them, especially when the topic is the text of the New Testament.
  </p>
  <p>
   In all, he has authored or edited fifty books, including The New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament: Its Background, Growth, and Content; The Text of the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament; The Canon of the New Testament, Manuscripts of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Greek Bible; Textual Commentary  on the Greek New Testament;
  </p>
  <p>
   Introduction to the Apocrypha; and The Oxford Companion to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible. Several have been translated into German, Chinese,
  </p>
  <p>
   Japanese, Korean, Malagasy, and other languages. He also is
  </p>
  <p>
   coeditor of The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha
  </p>
  <p>
   and general editor of more than twenty-five volumes in the series
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament Tools and Studies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metzger's education includes a master's degree from Princeton
  </p>
  <p>
   Theological Seminary and both a master's degree and a doctorate

   from Princeton University. He has been awarded honorary
  </p>
  <p>
   doctorates by five colleges and universities, including St.
  </p>
  <p>
   Andrews University in Scotland, the University of Munster in
  </p>
  <p>
   Germany, and Potchefstroom University in South Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1969 he served as resident scholar at Tyndale House,
  </p>
  <p>
   Cambridge,  England. He was a visiting fellow at Clare Hall,
  </p>
  <p>
   University of Cambridge, in 1974 and at Wolfson College, Oxford,
  </p>
  <p>
   in 1979. He is currently professor emeritus at Princeton
  </p>
  <p>
   Theological Seminary after a forty-six-year career teaching the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament.

  <p>
   Metzger is chairman of the New Revised Standard Version Bible
  </p>
  <p>
   Committee, a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, and
  </p>
  <p>
   serves on the Kuratorium of the Vetus Latina Institute at the
  </p>
  <p>
   Monastery of Beuron, Germany. He is past president of the Society
  </p>
  <p>
   of Biblical Literature,  the International Society for New
  </p>

   If you scan the footnotes of any authoritative book on the text
  </p>
  <p>
   of the New Testament, the odds are you're going to see Metzger
  </p>
  <p>
   cited time after time. His books are mandatory reading in
  </p>
  <p>
   universities and seminaries around the world. He is held in the
  </p>
  <p>
   highest regard by scholars from across a wide range of
  </p>
  <p>
   theological beliefs.
  </p>
  <p>
   In many ways Metzger, born in 1914, is a throwback to an earlier
  </p>
  <p>
   generation. Alighting from a gray Buick he calls "my gas buggy,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he is wearing a dark gray suit and blue paisley tie, which is
  </p>
  <p>
   about as casual as he gets during his visits to the library, even
  </p>
  <p>
   on a weekend. His white hair is neatly combed; his eyes, bright
  </p>
  <p>
   and alert, are framed by rimless glasses. He walks slower than he
  </p>
  <p>
   used to, but he has no difficulty  methodically climbing the
  </p>
  <p>
   stairway to the second floor, where he conducts his research in
  </p>
  <p>
   an obscure and austere office.
  </p>
  <p>
   And he hasn't lost his sense of humor. He showed me a tin
  </p>
  <p>
   canister  he inherited as chairman of the Revised Standard
  </p>
  <p>
   Version Bible Committee. He opened the lid to reveal the ashes of
  </p>
  <p>
   an RSV Bible that had been torched in a 1952 bonfire during a
  </p>
  <p>
   protest by a fundamentalist  preacher.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It seems he didn't like it when the committee changed 'fellows'
  </p>
  <p>
   of the King James Version to 'comrades' in Hebrews 1:9," Metzger
  </p>
  <p>
   explained with a chuckle. "He accused them of being communists!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Though Metzger's speech is hesitant at times and he's prone to
