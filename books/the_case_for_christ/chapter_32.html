   followed by the 'new man.' Trouble is, they never found the 'new
  </p>
  <p>
   man.' They got rid of the oppressors of the peasants, but that
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't mean the peasants were suddenly free-they were just under
  </p>
  <p>
   a new regime of darkness. In the final analysis, if you want
  </p>
  <p>
   lasting change, you've got to transform the hearts of human
  </p>
  <p>
   beings. And that was Jesus' mission. It's also worth asking the
  </p>
  <p>
   question that Sowell poses: how did slavery stop? He points out
  </p>
  <p>
   that the driving impetus for the abolition of slavery was the
  </p>
  <p>
   evangelical awakening in England. Christians rammed abolition
  </p>
  <p>
   through Parliament in the beginning of the nineteenth  century
  </p>
  <p>
   and then eventually used British gunboats to stop the slave trade
  </p>
  <p>
   across the Atlantic.
  </p>
  <p>
   While there were about eleven million Africans who were
  </p>
  <p>
   shipped to America-and many didn't make it-there were about
  </p>
  <p>
   thirteen million Africans shipped to become slaves in the Arab
  </p>
  <p>
   world. Again it was the British, prompted by people whose hearts
  </p>
  <p>
   had been changed by Christ, who sent their gunboats to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Persian Gulf to oppose this."
  </p>
  <p>
   Carson's response made sense not only historically but also in my
  </p>
  <p>
   own experience. For example, years ago I knew a businessman who
  </p>
  <p>
   was a rabid racist with a superior and condescending attitude
  </p>
  <p>
   toward anyone of another color. He hardly made any effort to
  </p>
  <p>
   conceal his contempt  for African-Americans, letting his bigoted
  </p>
  <p>
   bile frequently spill out in crude jokes and caustic remarks. No
  </p>
  <p>
   amount of arguments could dissuade him from his disgusting
  </p>
  <p>
   opinions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then he became a follower of Jesus. As I watched in amazement.
  </p>
  <p>
   his attitudes, his perspective, and his values changed over time,
  </p>
  <p>
   and his heart was renewed by God. He came to realize that he
  </p>
  <p>
   could no longer harbor ill-will toward any person, since the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible teaches that all people are made in the image of God. Today
  </p>
  <p>
   I can honestly say that he's genuinely caring and accepting
  </p>
  <p>
   toward others, including those who are different from him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Legislation didn't change him. Reasoning didn't change him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Emotional  appeals didn't change him. He'll tell you that God
  </p>
  <p>
   changed him from the inside out-decisively, completely,
  </p>
  <p>
   permanently. That's one of many examples I've seen of the power
  </p>
  <p>
   of the gospel that Carson was talking about-the power to
  </p>
  <p>
   transform vengeful haters into humanitarians,  hardhearted
  </p>
  <p>
   hoarders into softhearted givers, power-mongers into selfless
  </p>
  <p>
   servants, and people who exploit others-through slavery or some
  </p>
  <p>
   other form of oppression-into people who embrace all. This
  </p>
  <p>
   squares with what the apostle Paul said in Galatians 3:28: "There
  </p>
  <p>
   is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for
  </p>
  <p>
   you are all one in Christ Jesus."
  </p>
  <h2>
   MATCHING THE SKETCH OF GOD
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Carson and I talked, sometimes in animated tones, for two hours,
  </p>
  <p>
   filling  more tapes than would fit in this chapter. I found his
  </p>
  <p>
   answers to be well reasoned and theologically sound. In the end,
  </p>
  <p>
   however, how the Incarnation works-how Spirit takes on flesh-
  </p>
  <p>
   remained a mind boggling  concept.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even so, according to the Bible, the fact that it did occur is
  </p>
  <p>
   not in any doubt. Every attribute of God, says the New Testament,
  </p>
  <p>
   is found in Jesus Christ:
  </p>
  <p>
   + Omniscience? In John 16:30 the apostle John affirms of Jesus,
  </p>
  <p>
   "Now we can see that you know all things."
  </p>
  <p>
   +  Omnipresence? Jesus said in Matthew 28:20, "Surely I am
  </p>
  <p>
   with you always, to the very end of the age" and in Matthew
  </p>
  <p>
   18:20, "Where two or three come together in my name, there
  </p>
  <p>
   am I with them."
  </p>
  <p>
   +  Omnipotence? "All authority in heaven and on earth has been
  </p>
  <p>
   given to me," Jesus said in Matthew 28:18.
  </p>
  <p>
   +  Eternality? John 1:1 declares of Jesus, "In the beginning was
  </p>
  <p>
   the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." +
  </p>
  <p>
   Immutability? Hebrews 13:8 says, "Jesus Christ is the same
  </p>
  <p>
   yesterday and today and forever."
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, the Old Testament paints a portrait of God by using such
  </p>
  <p>
   titles and descriptions as Alpha and Omega, Lord, Savior, King,
  </p>
  <p>
   Judge, Light, Rock, Redeemer, Shepherd, Creator, giver of life,
  </p>
  <p>
   forgiver  of sin, and speaker with divine authority. It's
  </p>
  <p>
   fascinating to note that in the New Testament each and every one
  </p>
  <p>
   is applied to Jesus.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Jesus said it all in John 14:7: "If you really knew me, you would
  </p>
  <p>
   know my Father as well." Loose translation: "When you look at the
  </p>
  <p>
   sketch of God from the Old Testament, you will see a likeness of
  </p>
  <p>
   me."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <p>
   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.   Read Philippians 2:5-8, which talks about Jesus emptying
  </p>
  <p>
   himself and being born into humble circumstances, with the cross
  </p>
  <p>
   as his destination. What are some possible motivations for Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   to do this? Then read verses 9-11. What happens as a result of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' mission? What could prompt everyone to someday conclude
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus is Lord?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.   Has the idea of hell been an impediment in your spiritual
  </p>
  <p>
   journey? How do you respond to Carson's explanation of this
  </p>
  <p>
   issue?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.   Carson addressed some verses that on the surface seemed to
  </p>
  <p>
   suggest  that Jesus was a created being or a lesser God. Did you
  </p>
  <p>
   find his reasoning persuasive? Why or why not? What did his
  </p>
  <p>
   analysis of these issues teach you in terms of the need for
  </p>
  <p>
   appropriate background  information in interpreting Scripture?

   10: THE FINGERPRINT EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <p>
   Did jesus-and jesus Alone Match the Identity of the Messiah? It
  </p>
  <p>
   was an uneventful Saturday at the Hiller home in Chicago.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clarence Hiller spent the afternoon painting the trim on the
  </p>
  <p>
   outside of his two-story house on West 104th Street. By early
  </p>
  <p>
   evening he and his family had retired to bed. However, what
  </p>
  <p>
   happened next would change criminal law in America forever.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Hillers woke in the early morning hours of September 19,
  </p>
  <p>
   1910, and became suspicious that a gaslight near their daughter's
  </p>
  <p>
   bedroom had gone out. Clarence went to investigate. His wife
  </p>
  <p>
   heard a quick succession of sounds: a scuffle, two men tumbling
  </p>
  <p>
   down the stairs, two gunshots, and the slamming of the front
  </p>
  <p>
   door. She emerged to find Clarence dead at the foot of the
  </p>
  <p>
   stairs.
  </p>
  <p>
   Police arrested Thomas Jennings, a convicted burglar, less than a
  </p>
  <p>
   mile away. There was blood on his clothes and his left arm had
  </p>
  <p>
   been injured-both, he said, from falling on a streetcar. In his
  </p>
  <p>
   pocket they found the same kind of gun that had been used to
  </p>
  <p>
   shoot Clarence Hiller, but they couldn't determine if it was the
  </p>
  <p>
   murder weapon. Knowing they needed more to convict Jennings,
  </p>
  <p>
   detectives
  </p>
  <p>
   scoured the inside of Hiller's home in a search for additional
  </p>
  <p>
   clues. One fact soon became obvious: the killer had entered
  </p>
  <p>
   through a rear kitchen window. Detectives went outside-and there,
  </p>
  <p>
   next to that window, forever imprinted in the white paint that
  </p>
  <p>
   the murder victim himself had so carefully applied to a railing
  </p>
  <p>
   only hours before his death, they found four clear fingerprints
  </p>
  <p>
   from someone's left hand. Fingerprint evidence was a new concept
  </p>
  <p>
   at the time, having been recently introduced at an international
  </p>
  <p>
   police exhibition in St. Louis. So far, fingerprints had never
  </p>
  <p>
   been used to convict anyone of murder in the United States.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Despite strong objections by defense attorneys that such evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   was unscientific and inadmissible, four officers testified that
  </p>
  <p>
   the fingerprints  in the paint perfectly matched those of Thomas
  </p>
  <p>
   Jennings-and him alone. The jury found Jennings guilty, the
  </p>
  <p>
   Illinois Supreme Court upheld his conviction in a historic
  </p>
  <p>
   ruling, and he was later hanged. The premise behind fingerprint
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence is simple: each individual  has unique ridges on his or
  </p>
  <p>
   her fingers. When a print found on an object matches the pattern
  </p>
  <p>
   of ridges on a person's finger, investigators  can conclude with
  </p>
  <p>
   scientific certainty that this specific individual  has touched
  </p>
  <p>
   that object.
  </p>
  <p>
   In many criminal cases, fingerprint identification is the pivotal
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence. I remember covering a trial in which a single
  </p>
  <p>
   thumbprint found on the cellophane wrapper of a cigarette package
  </p>
  <p>
   was the determining  factor in convicting a twenty-year-old
  </p>
  <p>
   burglar of murdering a college coed.  That's how conclusive
  </p>
  <p>
   fingerprint evidence can be. OK, but what has this got to do with
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus Christ? Simply this: There is another kind of evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   that's analogous to fingerprints and establishes to an astounding
  </p>
  <p>
   degree of certainty that Jesus is indeed the Messiah of Israel
  </p>
  <p>
   and the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Jewish Scriptures, which Christians call the Old
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament, there are several dozen major prophecies about the
  </p>
  <p>
   coming of the Messiah,  who would be sent by God to redeem his
  </p>
  <p>
   people. In effect, these predictions formed a figurative
  </p>
  <p>
   fingerprint that only the Anointed One would be able to match.
  </p>
  <p>
   This way, the Israelites could rule out any impostors and
  </p>
  <p>
   validate the credentials of the authentic Messiah. The Greek word
  </p>
  <p>
   for "Messiah" is Christ. But was Jesus really the Christ? Did he
  </p>
  <p>
   miraculously fulfill these predictions that were written hundreds
  </p>
  <p>
   of years before he was born? And how do we know he was the only
  </p>
  <p>
   individual throughout history who fit the prophetic fingerprint?
  </p>
  <p>
   There are plenty of scholars with long strings of initials after
  </p>
  <p>
   their names whom I could have asked about this topic. However, I
  </p>
  <p>
   wanted to inter-view someone for whom this was more than just an
  </p>
  <p>
   abstract academic exercise, and that took me to a very unlikely
  </p>
  <p>
   setting in southern California.

   THE NINTH INTERVIEW: LOUIS S. LAPIDES, M.DIV., TH.M.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Usually a church would be a natural location in which to question
  </p>
  <p>
   someone about a biblical issue. But there was something different
  </p>
  <p>
   about sitting down with Pastor Louis Lapides in the sanctuary of
  </p>
  <p>
   his congregation on the morning after Sunday worship services.
  </p>
  <p>
   This setting  of pews and stained glass was not where you would
  </p>
  <p>
   expect to find a nice Jewish boy from Newark, New Jersey.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet that's Lapides' background. For someone with his heritage,
  </p>
  <p>
   the question of whether Jesus is the long-anticipated Messiah
  </p>
  <p>
   goes beyond theory. It's intensely personal, and I had sought out
  </p>
  <p>
   Lapides so I could hear the story of his own investigation of
  </p>
  <p>
   this critical issue. Lapides earned a bachelor's degree in
  </p>
  <p>
   theology from Dallas Baptist  University as well as a master of
  </p>
  <p>
   divinity and a master of theology degree in Old Testament and
  </p>
  <p>
   Semitics from Talbot Theological Seminary.  He served for a
  </p>
  <p>
   decade with Chosen People Ministries, talking about Jesus to
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish college students. He has taught in the Bible department of
  </p>
  <p>
   Biola University and worked for seven years as an instructor for
  </p>
  <p>
   Walk Through the Bible seminars. He is also the former president
  </p>
  <p>
   of a national network of fifteen messianic congregations. Slender
  </p>
  <p>
   and bespectacled, Lapides is soft-spoken but has a quick smile
  </p>
  <p>
   and ready laugh. He was upbeat and polite as he ushered me to a
  </p>
  <p>
   chair near the front of Beth Airiel Fellowship in Sherman Oaks,
  </p>
  <p>
   Califorriia.  I didn't want to begin by debating biblical
  </p>
  <p>
   nuances; instead I started by inviting Lapides to tell me the
  </p>
  <p>
   story of his spiritual journey. He folded his hands in his lap,
  </p>
  <p>
   looked at the dark wood walls for a moment as he decided where to
  </p>
  <p>
   start, and then began unfolding an extraordinary tale that took
  </p>
  <p>
   us from Newark to Greenwich Village to Vietnam to Los Angeles,
  </p>
  <p>
   from skepticism to faith, from Judaism to Christianity, from
