  <p>
   being stopped, bread and fish being multiplied, sons and
  </p>
  <p>
   daughters being raised from the dead. This is beyond any
  </p>
  <p>
   parallels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Third, Jesus' biggest distinctive is how he did miracles on his
  </p>
  <p>
   own authority. He is the one who says, 'If I, by the finger of
  </p>
  <p>
   God, cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is among you'-he's
  </p>
  <p>
   referring to himself He says, 'I have been anointed to set the
  </p>
  <p>
   captives free.' He does give God the Father credit for what he
  </p>
  <p>
   does, but you never find him asking God the Father to do it-he
  </p>
  <p>
   does it in the power of God the Father. And for that there is
  </p>
  <p>
   just no parallel.
  </p>
  <p>
   "This goes right along with the different way Jesus talked about
  </p>
  <p>
   himself-'all authority has been given to me,"honor me even as you
  </p>
  <p>
   honor the Father,"heaven and earth shall pass away but my word
  </p>
  <p>
   will not pass away.' You don't find rabbis talking like this
  </p>
  <p>
   anywhere." Havin been on the receiving end of that quick burst of
  </p>
  <p>
   arguments, I said with a chuckle, "So what's your point?" Boyd
  </p>
  <p>
   laughed. "Any parallels with wonder-working rabbis," he said,
  </p>
  <p>
   "are going to be very, very stretched."
  </p>
  <h2>
   JESUS AND THE AMAZING APOLLONIUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I wasn't going to let Boyd's debating skills intimidate me. I
  </p>
  <p>
   decided to raise a more difficult issue: the seemingly stronger
  </p>
  <p>
   parallels between Jesus and a historical figure named Apollonius
  </p>
  <p>
   of Tyana. "You know the evidence as well as I do," I said to
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd. "Here's someone from the first century who was said to have
  </p>
  <p>
   heated people and to have exorcised demons; who may have raised a
  </p>
  <p>
   young girl from the dead; and who appeared to some of his
  </p>
  <p>
   followers after he died. People point to that and say, 'Aha! If
  </p>
  <p>
   you're going to admit that the Apollonius story is legendary, why
  </p>
  <p>
   not say the same thing about the Jesus story?"'
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd was nodding to indicate he was tracking with me. "I'll admit
  </p>
  <p>
   that initially this sounds impressive," he said. "When I first
  </p>
  <p>
   heard about Apollonius as a college student, I was really taken
  </p>
  <p>
   aback. But if you do the historical work calmly and objectively,
  </p>
  <p>
   you find that the alleged parallels just don't stand up."
  </p>
  <p>
   I needed specifics, not generalities. "Go ahead," I said. "Do
  </p>
  <p>
   your best to shoot it down."
  </p>
  <p>
   "OK. Well, first, his biographer, Philostratus, was writing a
  </p>
  <p>
   century  and a half after Apollonius lived, whereas the gospels
  </p>
  <p>
   were written  within a generation of Jesus. The closer the
  </p>
  <p>
   proximity to the event, the less chance there is for legendary
  </p>
  <p>
   development, for error, or for memories to get confused.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another thing is that we have four gospels, corroborated with
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul, that can be cross-checked to some degree with nonbiblical
  </p>
  <p>
   authors, like Josephus and others. With Apollonius we're dealing
  </p>
  <p>
   with one source. Plus the gospels pass the standard tests used to
  </p>
  <p>
   assess historical  reliability, but we can't say that about the
  </p>
  <p>
   stories of Apollonius. On top of that, Philostratus was
  </p>
  <p>
   commissioned by an empress to write a biography in order to
  </p>
  <p>
   dedicate a temple to Apollonius. She was a follower of
  </p>
  <p>
   Apollonius, so Philostratus would have had a financial  motive to
  </p>
  <p>
   embellish the story and give the empress what she wanted. On the
  </p>
  <p>
   other hand, the writers of the gospel had nothing to gain-and
  </p>
  <p>
   much to lose-by writing Jesus' story, and they didn't have
  </p>
  <p>
   ulterior motives such as financial gain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, the way Philostratus writes is very different than the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels. The gospels have a very confident eyewitness
  </p>
  <p>
   perspective, as if they had a camera there. But Philostratus
  </p>
  <p>
   includes a lot of tentative statements, like 'It is reported that
  </p>
  <p>
   . ..' or 'Some say this young girl had died; others say she was
  </p>
  <p>
   just ill.' To his credit, he backs off and treats stories like
  </p>
  <p>
   stories.
  </p>
  <p>
   And here's a biggie: Philostratus was writing in the early third
  </p>
  <p>
   century in Cappadocia, where Christianity had already been
  </p>
  <p>
   present for quite a while. So any borrowing would have been done
  </p>
  <p>
   by him, not by Christians. You can imagine the followers of
  </p>
  <p>
   Apollonius seeing  Christianity as competition and saying, 'Oh,
  </p>
  <p>
   yeah? Well, Apollonius did the same things Jesus did!' Sort of
  </p>
  <p>
   like, 'My dad can beat up your dad.'
  </p>
  <p>
   One final point. I'm willing to admit that Apollonius may have
  </p>
  <p>
   done some amazing things or at least tricked people into thinking
  </p>
  <p>
   he did. But that doesn't in any way compromise the evidence for
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus. Even if you grant the evidence for Apollonius, you're
  </p>
  <p>
   still left with having to deal with the evidence for Christ."
  </p>
  <h2>
   JESUS AND THE "MYSTERY RELIGIONS"
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   OK, I thought to myself, let's give this one more try. A lot of
  </p>
  <p>
   college students are taught that many of the themes seen in the
  </p>
  <p>
   life of Jesus are merely echoes of ancient "mystery religions,"
  </p>
  <p>
   in which there are stories about gods dying and rising, and
  </p>
  <p>
   rituals of baptism and communion.  "What about those parallels?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "That was a very popular argument at the beginning of the century
  </p>
  <p>
   but it generally died off because it was so discredited. For one
  </p>
  <p>
   thing, given the timing involved, if you're going to argue for
  </p>
  <p>
   borrowing,  it should be from the direction of Christianity to
  </p>
  <p>
   the mystery religions,  not vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, the mystery religions were do-your-own-thing religions that
  </p>
  <p>
   freely borrowed ideas from various places. However, the Jews
  </p>
  <p>
   carefully guarded their beliefs from outside influences. They saw
  </p>
  <p>
   themselves as a separate people and strongly resisted pagan ideas
  </p>
  <p>
   and rituals."
  </p>
  <p>
   To me, the most interesting potential parallels were the
  </p>
  <p>
   mythological tales of gods dying and rising. "Aren't those
  </p>
  <p>
   stories similar to Christian beliefs?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "While it's true that some mystery religions had stories of gods
  </p>
  <p>
   dying and rising, these stories always revolved around the
  </p>
  <p>
   natural life cycle of death and rebirth," Boyd said. "Crops die
  </p>
  <p>
   in the fall and come to life in the spring. People express the
  </p>
  <p>
   wonder of this ongoing phenomenon through mythological stories
  </p>
  <p>
   about gods dying and rising.  These stories were always cast in a
  </p>
  <p>
   legendary form' . They depicted events that happened 'once upon a
  </p>
  <p>
   time.'
  </p>
  <p>
   "Contrast that with the depiction of Jesus Christ in the gospels.
  </p>
  <p>
   They talk about someone who actually lived several decades
  </p>
  <p>
   earlier, and they name names-crucified under Pontius Pilate, when
  </p>
  <p>
   Calaphas was the high priest, and the father of Alexander and
  </p>
  <p>
   Rufus carried his cross, for example. That's concrete historical
  </p>
  <p>
   stuff. It has nothing in common with stories about what
  </p>
  <p>
   supposedly happened once upon a time.'
  </p>
  <p>
   And Christianity has nothing to do with life cycles or the
  </p>
  <p>
   harvest.  It has to do with a very Jewish belief-which is absent
  </p>
  <p>
   from the mystery religions-about the resurrection of the dead and
  </p>
  <p>
   about life eternal and reconciliation with God.
  </p>
  <p>
   As for the suggestion that the New Testament doctrines of baptism
  </p>
  <p>
   or communion come from mystery religions, that's just nonsense.
  </p>
  <p>
   For one thing, the evidence for these supposed parallels comes
  </p>
  <p>
   after the Zsecond century, so any borrowing would have come from
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity,  not the other way around.
  </p>
  <p>
   And when you look carefully, the similarities vanish. For
  </p>
  <p>
   instance, to get to a higher level in the Mithra cult, followers
  </p>
  <p>
   had to stand under a bull while it was slain, so they could be
  </p>
  <p>
   bathed in its blood and guts. Then they'd join the others in
  </p>
  <p>
   eating the bull. Now, to suggest that Jews would find anything
  </p>
  <p>
   attractive about this and want to model baptism and communion
  </p>
  <p>
   after this barbaric practice is extremely implausible, which is
  </p>
  <p>
   why most scholars don't go for it."
  </p>
  <h2>
   SECRET GOSPELS AND TALKING CROSSES
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   As disorderly and disorganized as his office was, Boyd's mind was
  </p>
  <p>
   sharp and systematized. His analysis of these much touted
  </p>
  <p>
   parallels left little room for doubt. So I decided to advance to
  </p>
  <p>
   another area that the media often write about: the "new
  </p>
  <p>
   discoveries" that are often the subject of books by Jesus Seminar
  </p>
  <p>
   participants.
  </p>
  <p>
   "There has been a lot written in the popular press about the
  </p>
  <p>
   Gospel of Thomas, Secret Mark, the Cross Gospel, and Q," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Have there really been any new discoveries that change the way
  </p>
  <p>
   we should think about Jesus?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd sighed in exasperation. "No, there are no new discoveries
  </p>
  <p>
   that tell us anything new about Jesus. The Gospel of Thomas was
  </p>
  <p>
   discovered  long ago, but it's only now being used to create an
  </p>
  <p>
   alternative Jesus. Some theories about the Gospel of Thomas may
  </p>
  <p>
   be new, but the gospel itself is not.
  </p>
  <p>
   As for Q, it's not a discovery but a theory that has been around
  </p>
  <p>
   for one and a half centuries, which tries to account for the
  </p>
  <p>
   material that Luke and Matthew have in common. What's new is the
  </p>
  <p>
   highly questionable way that left-wing scholars are using their
  </p>
  <p>
   presuppositions  to slice this hypothetical Q into various layers
  </p>
  <p>
   of legendary development to back up their preconceived theories."
  </p>
  <p>
   I knew that John Dominic Crossan, perhaps the most influential
  </p>
  <p>
   scholar in the Jesus Seminar, has made some strong claims about a
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel called Secret Mark. In fact, he asserts that Secret Mark
  </p>
  <p>
   may actually be an uncensored version of the gospel of Mark,
  </p>
  <p>
   containing confidential matters for spiritual insiders.' Some
  </p>
  <p>
   have used it to claim that Jesus was actually a magician or that
  </p>
  <p>
   a number of early Christians  practiced homosexuality. This
  </p>
  <p>
   conspiratorial scenario has captured  the media's imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What proof is there for this?" I asked Boyd.
  </p>
  <p>
   His answer came quickly. "None," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though he apparently didn't see the need to elaborate, I asked
  </p>
  <p>
   him to explain what he meant.
  </p>
  <p>
   "You see, we don't have Secret Mark," he said. "What we have is
  </p>
  <p>
   one scholar who found a quote from Clement of Alexandria, from
  </p>
  <p>
   late in the second century, that supposedly comes from this
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel. And now, mysteriously, even that is gone, disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>
   "We don't have it, we don't have a quote from it, and even if we
  </p>
  <p>
   did have a quote from it, we don't have any reason to think that
  </p>
  <p>
   it has given us any valid information about the historical Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   or what early Christians thought about him. On top of that, we
  </p>
  <p>
   already know that Clement had a track record of being very
  </p>
  <p>
   gullible in accepting spurious  writings.
  </p>
  <p>
   "So Secret Mark is a nonexistent work cited by a now nonexistent
  </p>
  <p>
   text by a late second-century writer who's known for being naive
  </p>
  <p>
   about these things. The vast majority of scholars don't give this
  </p>
  <p>
   any credibility.  Unfortunately, those who do get a lot of press,
  </p>
  <p>
   because the media love the sensational."
  </p>
  <p>
   Crossan also gives credence to what he calls the Cross Gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Does that fare any better?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "No, most scholars don't give it credibility, because it includes
  </p>
  <p>
   such outlandishly legendary material. For instance, Jesus comes
  </p>
  <p>
   out of his tomb and he's huge-he goes up beyond the sky-and the
  </p>
  <p>
   Cross comes out of the tomb and actually talks! Obviously, the
  </p>
  <p>
   much more sober gospels are more reliable than anything found in
  </p>
  <p>
   this account. It fits better with later apocryphal writings. In
  </p>
  <p>
   fact, it's dependent on biblical material, so it should be dated
  </p>
  <p>
   later." Unlike the overwhelming majority of biblical experts, the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus Seminar has accorded extremely high status to the Gospel of
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomas, elevating it to a place alongside the four traditional
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels. In chapter  3 Dr. Bruce Metzger strongly criticized that
  </p>
  <p>
   position as being unwarranted.
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked Boyd for his opinion. "Why shouldn't Thomas be given that
  </p>
  <p>
   kind of honor?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Everyone concedes that this gospel has been significantly
  </p>
  <p>
   influenced  by Gnosticism, which was a religious movement in the
  </p>
  <p>
   second, third, and fourth centuries that supposedly had secret
  </p>
  <p>
   insights, knowledge,  or revelations that would allow people to
  </p>
  <p>
   know the key to the Universe. Salvation was by what you knew-
  </p>
  <p>
   gnosis is Greek for 'know,"' he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "So most scholars date the Gospel of Thomas to the mid-second
  </p>
  <p>
   century, in which it fits well into the cultural milieu. Let me
  </p>
  <p>
   give you an example: Jesus is quoted as saying, 'Every woman who
  </p>
  <p>
   will make herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven.' That
  </p>
  <p>
   contradicts the attitude that we know Jesus had toward women, but
