  <p>
   the fidelity with which this material has come down to us,
  </p>
  <p>
   especially compared with any other ancient literary work."
  </p>
  <p>
   That conclusion is shared by distinguished scholars throughout
  </p>
  <p>
   the world. Said the late F. F. Bruce, eminent professor at the
  </p>
  <p>
   University  of Manchester, England, and author of The New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament Documents:  Are They Reliable?: "There is no body of
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient literature in the world which enjoys such a wealth of
  </p>
  <p>
   good textual attestation as the New Testament."
  </p>
  <p>
   Metzger had already mentioned the name of Sir Frederic
  </p>
  <p>
   Kenyon, former director of the British Museum and author of The
  </p>
  <p>
   Palaeography of Greek Papyri. Kenyon has said that "in no other
  </p>
  <p>
   case is the interval of time between the composition of the book
  </p>
  <p>
   and the date of the earliest manuscripts so short as in that of
  </p>
  <p>
   the New Testament."
  </p>
  <p>
   His conclusion: "The last foundation for any doubt that the
  </p>
  <p>
   scriptures  have come down to us substantially as they were
  </p>
  <p>
   written has now been removed."
  </p>
  <p>
   However, what about discrepancies among the various manuscripts?
  </p>
  <p>
   In the days before lightning-fast photocopying machines,
  </p>
  <p>
   manuscripts were laboriously hand-copied by scribes, letter by
  </p>
  <p>
   letter, word by word, line by line, in a process that was ripe
  </p>
  <p>
   for errors. Now I wanted to zero in on whether these copying
  </p>
  <p>
   mistakes have rendered our modern Bibles hopelessly riddled with
  </p>
  <p>
   inaccuracies.
  </p>
  <h2>
   EXAMINING THE ERRORS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "With the similarities in the way Greek letters are written and
  </p>
  <p>
   with the primitive conditions under which the scribes worked, it
  </p>
  <p>
   would seem inevitable that copying errors would creep into the
  </p>
  <p>
   text," I said. "Quite so," Metzger conceded.
  </p>
  <p>
   "And in fact, aren't there literally tens of thousands of
  </p>
  <p>
   variations among the ancient manuscripts that we have?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Quite so."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Doesn't that therefore mean we can't trust them?" I asked,
  </p>
  <p>
   sounding more accusatory than inquisitive.
  </p>
  <p>
   "No sir, it does not," Metzger replied firmly. "First let me say
  </p>
  <p>
   this: Eyeglasses weren't invented until 1373 in Venice, and I'm
  </p>
  <p>
   sure that astigmatism existed among the ancient scribes. That was
  </p>
  <p>
   compounded by the fact that it was difficult under any
  </p>
  <p>
   circumstances to read faded manuscripts on which some of the ink
  </p>
  <p>
   had flaked away. And there were other hazards-inattentiveness on
  </p>
  <p>
   the part of scribes, for example.  So yes, although for the most
  </p>
  <p>
   part scribes were scrupulously careful,  errors did creep in.
  </p>
  <p>
   "But," he was quick to add, "there are factors counteracting
  </p>
  <p>
   that. For example, sometimes the scribe's memory would play
  </p>
  <p>
   tricks on him. Between the time it took for him to look at the
  </p>
  <p>
   text and then to write down the words, the order of words might
  </p>
  <p>
   get shifted. He may write down the right words but in the wrong
  </p>
  <p>
   sequence. This is nothing to be alarmed at, because Greek, unlike
  </p>
  <p>
   English, is an inflected language." "Meaning . . . " I prompted
  </p>
  <p>
   him.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Meaning it makes a whale of a difference in English if you say,
  </p>
  <p>
   'Dog bites man' or 'Man bites dog'-sequence matters in English.
  </p>
  <p>
   But in Greek it doesn't. One word functions as the subject of the
  </p>
  <p>
   sentence  regardless of where it stands in the sequence;
  </p>
  <p>
   consequently, the meaning of the sentence isn't distorted if the
  </p>
  <p>
   words are out of what we consider to be the right order. So yes,
  </p>
  <p>
   some variations among manuscripts  exist, but generally they're
  </p>
  <p>
   inconsequential variations like that. Differences in spelling
  </p>
  <p>
   would be another example."
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, the high number of "variants," or differences among
  </p>
  <p>
   manuscripts,  was troubling. I had seen estimates as high as two
  </p>
  <p>
   hundred thousand of them.' However, Metzger downplayed the
  </p>
  <p>
   significance of that figure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The number sounds big, but it's a bit misleading because of the
  </p>
  <p>
   way variants are counted," he said. He explained that if a single
  </p>
  <p>
   word is misspelled in two thousand manuscripts, that's counted as
  </p>
  <p>
   two thousand  variants.
  </p>
  <p>
   I keyed in on the most important issue. "How many doctrines of
  </p>
  <p>
   the church are in jeopardy because of variants?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I don't know of any doctrine that is in jeopardy," he responded
  </p>
  <p>
   confidently.
  </p>
  <p>
   "None?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "None," he repeated. "Now, the Jehovah's Witnesses come to our
  </p>
  <p>
   door and say, 'Your Bible is wrong in the King James Version of 1
  </p>
  <p>
   John 5:7-8, where it talks about 'the Father, the Word, and the
  </p>
  <p>
   Holy Ghost: and these three are one.' They'll say, 'That's not in
  </p>
  <p>
   the earliest manuscripts.'
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "And that's true enough. I think that these words are found in
  </p>
  <p>
   only about seven or eight copies, all from the fifteenth or
  </p>
  <p>
   sixteenth century. I acknowledge that is not part of what the
  </p>
  <p>
   author of I John was inspired to write.
  </p>
  <p>
   "But that does not dislodge the firmly witnessed testimony of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible to the doctrine of the Trinity. At the baptism of Jesus,
  </p>
  <p>
   the Father speaks, his beloved Son is baptized, and the Holy
  </p>
  <p>
   Spirit descends on him. At the ending of 2 Corinthians Paul says,
  </p>
  <p>
   'May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
  </p>
  <p>
   the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.' There are
  </p>
  <p>
   many places where the Trinity is represented."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So the variations, when they occur, tend to be minor rather than
  </p>
  <p>
   substantive?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, yes, that's correct, and scholars work very carefully to
  </p>
  <p>
   try to resolve them by getting back to the original meaning. The
  </p>
  <p>
   more significant variations do not overthrow any doctrine of the
  </p>
  <p>
   church. Any good Bible will have notes that will alert the reader
  </p>
  <p>
   to variant readings of any consequence. But again, these are
  </p>
  <p>
   rare."
  </p>
  <p>
   So rare that scholars Norman Geisler and William Nix conclude,
  </p>
  <p>
   "The New Testament, then, has not only survived in more
  </p>
  <p>
   manuscripts than any other book from antiquity, but it has
  </p>
  <p>
   survived in a purer form than any other great book-aform that is
  </p>
  <p>
   99.5 percent pure." However, even if it's true that the
  </p>
  <p>
   transmission of the New Testament  through history has been
  </p>
  <p>
   unprecedented in its reliability, how do we know that we have the
  </p>
  <p>
   whole picture?
  </p>
  <p>
   What about allegations that church councils squelched equally
  </p>
  <p>
   legitimate documents because they didn't like the picture of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus they portrayed? How do we know that the twenty-seven books
  </p>
  <p>
   of the New Testament represent the best and most reliable
  </p>
  <p>
   information? Why is it that our Bibles contain Matthew, Mark,
  </p>
  <p>
   Luke, and John, but many other ancient gospels-the Gospel of
  </p>
  <p>
   Philip, the Gospel of the Egyptians, the Gospel of Truth, the
  </p>
  <p>
   Gospel of Nativity of Mary-were excluded? It was time to turn to
  </p>
  <p>
   the question of the "canon," a term that comes from a Greek word
  </p>
  <p>
   meaning "rule," "norm," or "standard" and that describes the
  </p>
  <p>
   books that have become accepted as official in the church and
  </p>
  <p>
   included in the New Testament.' Metzger is considered a leading
  </p>
  <p>
   authority in that field.
  </p>
  <h2>
   "A HIGH DEGREE OF UNANIMITY"
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "How did the early church leaders determine which books would be
  </p>
  <p>
   considered authoritative and which would be discarded?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What criteria did they use in determining which documents would
  </p>
  <p>
   be included in the New Testament?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Basically, the early church had three criteria," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "First, the books must have apostolic authority-that is, they
  </p>
  <p>
   must have been written either by apostles themselves, who were
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitnesses to what they wrote about, or by followers of
  </p>
  <p>
   apostles. So in the case of Mark and Luke, while they weren't
  </p>
  <p>
   among the twelve disciples, early tradition has it that Mark was
  </p>
  <p>
   a helper of Peter, and Luke was an associate  of Paul.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Second, there was the criterion of conformity to what was called
  </p>
  <p>
   the rule of faith. That is, was the document congruent with the
  </p>
  <p>
   basic Christian tradition that the church recognized as
  </p>
  <p>
   normative? And third, there was the criterion of whether a
  </p>
  <p>
   document had had continuous  acceptance and usage by the church
  </p>
  <p>
   at large."
  </p>
  <p>
   "They merely applied those criteria and let the chips fall where
  </p>
  <p>
   they may?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, it wouldn't be accurate to say that these criteria were
  </p>
  <p>
   simply  applied in a mechanical fashion," he replied. "There were
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly  different opinions about which criterion should be
  </p>
  <p>
   given the most weight.
  </p>
  <p>
   "But what's remarkable is that even though the fringes of the
  </p>
  <p>
   canon remained unsettled for a while, there was actually a high
  </p>
  <p>
   degree of unanimity concerning the greater part of the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament  within the first two centuries. And this was true
  </p>
  <p>
   among very diverse congregations scattered over a wide area."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "So," I said, "the four gospels we have in the New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   today met those criteria, while others didn't?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes," he said. "It was, if I may put it this way, an example of
  </p>
  <p>
   survival of the fittest! In talking about the canon, Arthur Darby
  </p>
  <p>
   Nock used to tell his students at Harvard, 'The most traveled
  </p>
  <p>
   roads in Europe are the best roads; that's why they're so heavily
  </p>
  <p>
   traveled.' That's a good analogy. British commentator William
  </p>
  <p>
   Barclay said it this way: 'It is the simple truth to say that the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament books became canonical because no one could stop
  </p>
  <p>
   them doing so.'
  </p>
  <p>
   We can be confident that no other ancient books can compare with
  </p>
  <p>
   the New Testament in terms of importance for Christian history or
  </p>
  <p>
   doctrine. When one studies the early history of the canon, one
  </p>
  <p>
   walks away convinced that the New Testament contains the best
  </p>
  <p>
   sources for the history of Jesus. Those who discerned the limits
  </p>
  <p>
   of the canon had a clear and balanced perspective of the gospel
  </p>
  <p>
   of Christ. Just read these other documents for yourself. They're
  </p>
  <p>
   written later than the four gospels, in the second, third,
  </p>
  <p>
   fourth, fifth, even sixth century, long after Jesus, and they're
  </p>
  <p>
   generally quite banal. They carry names-like the Gospel of Peter
  </p>
  <p>
   and the Gospel of Mary-that are unrelated to their real
  </p>
  <p>
   authorship. On the other hand, the four gospels in the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament were readily accepted with remarkable unanimity as
  </p>
  <p>
   being authentic in the story they told."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Yet I knew that some liberal scholars, most notably members of
  </p>
  <p>
   the well-publicized Jesus Seminar, believe the Gospel of Thomas
  </p>
  <p>
   ought to be elevated to equal status with the four traditional
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels. Did this mysterious gospel fall victim to political wars
  </p>
  <p>
   within the church, eventually being excluded because of its
  </p>
  <p>
   unpopular doctrines?  I decided I'd better probe Metzger on this
  </p>
  <p>
   point.

  <h2>
   THE "SECRET WORDS" OF JESUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Dr. Metzger, the Gospel of Thomas, which was among the Nag
  </p>
  <p>
   Hamrnadi  documents found in Egypt in 1945, claims it contains
  </p>
  <p>
   'the secret words which the living Jesus spoke and Didymus Judas
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomas wrote down., Why was it excluded by the church?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Metzger was thoroughly acquainted with the work. 'The Gospel of
  </p>
  <p>
   Thomas came to light in a fifth-century copy in Coptic, which
  </p>
  <p>
   I've translated into English," he said. "It contains 114 sayings
  </p>
  <p>
   attributed to Jesus but no narrative of what he did, and seems to
  </p>
  <p>
   have been written in Greek in Syria about A.D. 140. In some cases
  </p>
  <p>
   I think this gospel correctly  reports what Jesus said, with
  </p>
  <p>
   slight modifications."
  </p>
  <p>
   This was certainly an intriguing statement. "Please elaborate," I
  </p>
  <p>
   said.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "For instance, in the Gospel of Thomas Jesus says, 'A city built
  </p>
  <p>
   on a high hill cannot be hidden.' Here the adjective high is
  </p>
  <p>
   added, but the rest reads like Matthew's gospel. Or Jesus says,
  </p>
  <p>
   'Render to Caesar  the things that are Caesar's, render to God
  </p>
  <p>
   the things that are God's, render to me the things that are
  </p>
  <p>
   mine.' In this case the later phrase has been added.
  </p>
  <p>
   "However, there are some things in Thomas that are totally alien
