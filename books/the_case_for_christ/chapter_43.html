   some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles."  In the next verse, Paul adds, "And last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born." On the face of it, this is incredibly influential testimony that Jesus did appear alive after his death. Here were names of specific individuals  and groups of people who saw him, written at a time when people could still check them out if they wanted confirmation. Since I knew that the creed would be pivotal in establishing the Resurrection, I decided to subject it to greater scrutiny: Why are historians convinced it's a creed? How trustworthy is it? How far back does it go? "Do you mind if I cross-examine you on this creed?" I asked Habermas. He extended his hand as if to invite the inquiry. "Please," he said politely, "go ahead "
  </p>
  <h2>
   "CONVINCE ME IT'S A CREED"
  </h2>
  <p>
   Initially I wanted to determine why Habermas, Craig, Blomberg, and others are convinced that this passage is a creed of the early church and not just the words of Paul, who wrote the letter to the Corinthian church in which it's contained. My challenge to Habermas was simple and direct: "Convince me it's a creed." "Well, I can give you several solid reasons. First, Paul introduces it with the words received and delivered [or passed on in the NIV], which are technical rabbinic terms indicating he's passing along holy tradition. Second," Habermas said, looking down at his hands as he grabbed a finger at a time to emphasize each point he was making, "the text's parallelism and stylized content indicate it's a creed. Third, the original text uses Cephas for Peter, which is his Aramaic name. In fact, the Aramaic itself could indicate a very early origin. Fourth, the creed uses several other primitive phrases that Paul would not customarily use, like 'the Twelve,"the third day,"he was raised,' and others. Fifth, the use of certain words is similar to Aramaic and Mishnaic  Hebrew means of narration." Having run out of fingers, he looked up at me. "Should I go on?" he asked. "OK, OK," I said. "You're saying that these facts convince you, as a conservative evangelical Christian, that this is an early creed." Habermas seemed a bit offended by that admittedly barbed remark. "It's not just conservative Christians who are convinced," he insisted indignantly. "This is an assessment that's shared by a wide range of scholars from across a broad theological spectrum. The eminent  scholar Joachim Jeremias refers to this creed as 'the earliest tradition  of all,' and Ulrich Wilckens says it 'indubitably goes back to the oldest phase of all in the history of primitive Christianity.'" That raised the question of how primitive the creed is. "How far back can you date it?" I asked. "We know that Paul wrote I Corinthians between A.D. 55 and 57. He indicates in I Corinthians 15:1-4 that he has already passed on this creed to the church at Corinth, which would mean it must predate his visit there in A.D. 51. Therefore the creed was being used within twenty years of the Resurrection, which is quite early. However, I'd agree with the various scholars who trace it back even further, to within two to eight years of the Resurrection, or from about A.D. 32 to 38, when Paul received it in either Damascus or Jerusalem. So this is incredibly early material- primitive, unadorned testimony to the fact that Jesus appeared alive to skeptics like Paul and James, as well as to Peter and the rest of the disciples."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   But," I protested, "it's not really a firsthand account. Paul is providing  the list second- or thirdhand. Doesn't that diminish its value as evidence?"
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Not to Habermas. "Keep in mind that Paul personally affirms that Jesus appeared to him as well, so this provides firsthand testimony. And Paul didn't just pick up this list from strangers on the street. The leading view is that he got it directly from the eyewitnesses Peter and James themselves, and he took great pains to confirm its accuracy." That was a strong claim. "How do you know that?" I asked. "I would concur with the scholars who believe Paul received this material three years after his conversion, when he took a trip to Jerusalem and met with Peter and James. Paul describes that trip in Galatians 1:18-19, where he uses a very interesting Greek wordhistoreo."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I wasn't familiar with the meaning of the word. "Why is that significant?" "Because this word indicates that he didn't just casually shoot the breeze when he met with them. It shows this was an investigative inquiry. Paul was playing the role of an examiner, someone who was carefully checking this out. So the fact that Paul personally confirmed matters with two eyewitnesses who are specifically mentioned in the creed-Peter and James-gives this extra weight. One of the very few Jewish New Testament scholars, Pinchas Lapide, says the evidence  in support of the creed is so strong that it 'may be considered as a statement of eyewitnesses." Before I could jump in, Habermas added, "And later, in I Corinthians  15:11, Paul emphasizes that the other apostles agreed in preaching the same gospel, this same message about the Resurrection.  This means that what the eyewitness Paul is saying is the exact same thing as what the eyewitnesses Peter and James are saying." I'll admit it: all this sounded pretty convincing. Still, I had some reservations about the creed, and I didn't want Habermas's confident assertions to deter me from probing further.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE MYSTERY OF THE FIVE HUNDRED
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The creed in I Corinthians 15 is the only place in ancient literature where it is claimed that Jesus appeared to five hundred people at once. The gospels don't corroborate it. No secular historian mentions it. And to me, that raises a yellow flag. "If this really happened, why doesn't anyone else talk about it?" I asked Habermas. "You'd think the apostles would cite this as evidence  wherever they went. As the atheist Michael Martin says, 'One must conclude that it is extremely unlikely that this incident really occurred' and that this therefore 'indirectly casts doubt on Paul as a reliable source.'" That remark bothered Habermas. "Well, it's just plain silliness to say this casts doubt on Paul," he replied, sounding both astonished and annoyed that someone would make that claim. "I mean, give me a break! First, even though it's only reported in one source, it just so happens to be the earliest and best- authenticated  passage of all! That counts for something. Second, Paul apparently had some proximity to these people. He says, 'most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.' Paul either knew some of these people or was told by some-one who knew them that they were still walking around and willing to be interviewed. Now, stop and think about it: you would never include this phrase unless you were absolutely confident that these folks would confirm that they really did see Jesus alive. I mean, Paul was virtually  inviting people to check it out for themselves! He wouldn't have said this if he didn't know they'd back him up. Third, when you have only one source, you can ask, 'Why aren't there more?' But you can't say, 'This one source is crummy on the grounds that someone else didn't pick up on it.' You can't downgrade this one source that way. So this doesn't cast any doubt on Paul at all - believe me, Martin would love to be able to do that, but he can't do it legitimately. This is an example of how some critics want it both ways. Generally,  they denigrate the gospel Resurrection accounts in favor of Paul, since he is taken to be the chief authority. But on this issue, they're questioning Paul for the sake of texts that they don't trust as much in the first place! What does this say about their methodology?" I was still having trouble envisioning this appearance by Jesus to such a large crowd. "Where would this encounter with five hundred  people have taken place?" I asked. "Well, the Galilean countryside," Habermas speculated. "If Jesus could feed five thousand, he could preach to five hundred. And Matthew does say Jesus appeared on a hillside; maybe more than just the eleven disciples were there." Picturing that scene in my mind, I still couldn't help but wonder why someone else didn't report on this event. "Wouldn't it be likely that the historian Josephus would have mentioned something of that magnitude?" "No, I don't think that's necessarily true. Josephus was writing sixty years afterward. How long do local stories circulate before they start to die out?" Habermas asked. "So either Josephus didn't know about it, which is possible, or he chose not to mention it, which would make sense because we know Josephus was not a follower of Jesus. You can't expect Josephus to start building the case for him." When I didn't respond for a moment, Habermas continued. "Look, I'd love to have five sources for this. I don't. But I do have one excellent  source-a creed that's so good that German historian Hans von Campenhausen says, 'This account meets all the demands of historical reliability that could possibly be made of such a text.' Besides, you don't need to rely on the reference to the five hundred to make the case for the Resurrection. Usually I don't even use it." Habermas's answer carried some logic. Still, there was another aspect of the creed that weighed on me: it says Jesus appeared first to Peter, whereas John said he appeared first to Mary Magdalene. In fact, the creed doesn't mention any women, even though they're prominently featured in the gospel accounts. "Don't these contradictions hurt its credibility?" I asked. "Ah, no," came the reply. "First of all, look at the creed carefully: it doesn't say Jesus appeared first to Peter. All it does is put Peter's name first on the list. And since women were not considered competent  as witnesses in first-century Jewish culture, it's not surprising that they're not mentioned here. In the first-century scheme of things, their testimony wouldn't carry any weight. So placing Peter first could indicate logical priority rather than temporal priority. Again," he concluded, "the creed's credibility remains intact. You've raised some questions, but wouldn't you concede that they don't undermine the persuasive evidence that the creed is early, that it's free from legendary contamination, that it's unambiguous and specific,  and that it's ultimately rooted in eyewitness accounts?" All in all, I was forced to agree that he was right. The weight of the evidence clearly and convincingly supports the creed as being powerful evidence for Jesus' post-Resurrection appearances. So powerful that William Lane Craig, the Resurrection expert I interviewed in the previous chapter, said that Wolfhart Parmenberg, perhaps the greatest living systematic theologian in the world, "has rocked modern, skeptical German theology by building his entire theology  precisely on the historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus as supplied in Paul's list of appearances. Having satisfied myself about the essential reliability of the I Corinthians  15 creed, it was time to begin looking at the four gospels, which recount the various appearances by the resurrected Jesus in more detail.
