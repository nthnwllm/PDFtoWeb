  <p>
   some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all
  </p>
  <p>
   the apostles."  In the next verse, Paul adds, "And last of all he
  </p>
  <p>
   appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born."
  </p>
  <p>
   On the face of it, this is incredibly influential testimony that
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus did appear alive after his death. Here were names of
  </p>
  <p>
   specific individuals  and groups of people who saw him, written
  </p>
  <p>
   at a time when people could still check them out if they wanted
  </p>
  <p>
   confirmation. Since I knew that the creed would be pivotal in
  </p>
  <p>
   establishing the Resurrection, I decided to subject it to greater
  </p>
  <p>
   scrutiny: Why are historians convinced it's a creed? How
  </p>
  <p>
   trustworthy is it? How far back does it go? "Do you mind if I
  </p>
  <p>
   cross-examine you on this creed?" I asked Habermas.
  </p>
  <p>
   He extended his hand as if to invite the inquiry. "Please," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said politely, "go ahead "
  </p>
  <h2>
   "CONVINCE ME IT'S A CREED"
  </h2>
  <p>
   Initially I wanted to determine why Habermas, Craig, Blomberg,
  </p>
  <p>
   and others are convinced that this passage is a creed of the
  </p>
  <p>
   early church and not just the words of Paul, who wrote the letter
  </p>
  <p>
   to the Corinthian church in which it's contained.
  </p>
  <p>
   My challenge to Habermas was simple and direct: "Convince me it's
  </p>
  <p>
   a creed."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, I can give you several solid reasons. First, Paul
  </p>
  <p>
   introduces it with the words received and delivered [or passed on
  </p>
  <p>
   in the NIV], which are technical rabbinic terms indicating he's
  </p>
  <p>
   passing along holy tradition. Second," Habermas said, looking
  </p>
  <p>
   down at his hands as he
  </p>
  <p>
   grabbed a finger at a time to emphasize each point he was making,
  </p>
  <p>
   "the text's parallelism and stylized content indicate it's a
  </p>
  <p>
   creed. Third, the original text uses Cephas for Peter, which is
  </p>
  <p>
   his Aramaic name. In fact, the Aramaic itself could indicate a
  </p>
  <p>
   very early origin. Fourth, the creed uses several other primitive
  </p>
  <p>
   phrases that Paul would not customarily use, like 'the
  </p>
  <p>
   Twelve,"the third day,"he was raised,' and others. Fifth, the use
  </p>
  <p>
   of certain words is similar to Aramaic and Mishnaic  Hebrew means
  </p>
  <p>
   of narration."
  </p>
  <p>
   Having run out of fingers, he looked up at me. "Should I go on?"
  </p>
  <p>
   he asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "OK, OK," I said. "You're saying that these facts convince you,
  </p>
  <p>
   as a conservative evangelical Christian, that this is an early
  </p>
  <p>
   creed." Habermas seemed a bit offended by that admittedly barbed
  </p>
  <p>
   remark. "It's not just conservative Christians who are
  </p>
  <p>
   convinced," he insisted indignantly. "This is an assessment
  </p>
  <p>
   that's shared by a wide range of scholars from across a broad
  </p>
  <p>
   theological spectrum. The eminent  scholar Joachim Jeremias
  </p>
  <p>
   refers to this creed as 'the earliest tradition  of all,' and
  </p>
  <p>
   Ulrich Wilckens says it 'indubitably goes back to the oldest
  </p>
  <p>
   phase of all in the history of primitive Christianity.'" That
  </p>
  <p>
   raised the question of how primitive the creed is. "How far back
  </p>
  <p>
   can you date it?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "We know that Paul wrote I Corinthians between A.D. 55 and 57. He
  </p>
  <p>
   indicates in I Corinthians 15:1-4 that he has already passed on
  </p>
  <p>
   this creed to the church at Corinth, which would mean it must
  </p>
  <p>
   predate his visit there in A.D. 51. Therefore the creed was being
  </p>
  <p>
   used within twenty years of the Resurrection, which is quite
  </p>
  <p>
   early.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, I'd agree with the various scholars who trace it back
  </p>
  <p>
   even further, to within two to eight years of the Resurrection,
  </p>
  <p>
   or from about A.D. 32 to 38, when Paul received it in either
  </p>
  <p>
   Damascus or Jerusalem. So this is incredibly early material-
  </p>
  <p>
   primitive, unadorned testimony to the fact that Jesus appeared
  </p>
  <p>
   alive to skeptics like Paul and James, as well as to Peter and
  </p>
  <p>
   the rest of the disciples."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   But," I protested, "it's not really a firsthand account. Paul is
  </p>
  <p>
   providing  the list second- or thirdhand. Doesn't that diminish
  </p>
  <p>
   its value as evidence?"
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Not to Habermas. "Keep in mind that Paul personally affirms that
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus appeared to him as well, so this provides firsthand
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony. And Paul didn't just pick up this list from strangers
  </p>
  <p>
   on the street. The leading view is that he got it directly from
  </p>
  <p>
   the eyewitnesses Peter and James themselves, and he took great
  </p>
  <p>
   pains to confirm its accuracy." That was a strong claim. "How do
  </p>
  <p>
   you know that?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I would concur with the scholars who believe Paul received this
  </p>
  <p>
   material three years after his conversion, when he took a trip to
  </p>
  <p>
   Jerusalem and met with Peter and James. Paul describes that trip
  </p>
  <p>
   in Galatians 1:18-19, where he uses a very interesting Greek
  </p>
  <p>
   wordhistoreo."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I wasn't familiar with the meaning of the word. "Why is that
  </p>
  <p>
   significant?" "Because this word indicates that he didn't just
  </p>
  <p>
   casually shoot the breeze when he met with them. It shows this
  </p>
  <p>
   was an investigative inquiry. Paul was playing the role of an
  </p>
  <p>
   examiner, someone who was carefully checking this out. So the
  </p>
  <p>
   fact that Paul personally confirmed matters with two eyewitnesses
  </p>
  <p>
   who are specifically mentioned in the creed-Peter and James-gives
  </p>
  <p>
   this extra weight. One of the very few Jewish New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars, Pinchas Lapide, says the evidence  in support of the
  </p>
  <p>
   creed is so strong that it 'may be considered as a statement of
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitnesses."
  </p>
  <p>
   Before I could jump in, Habermas added, "And later, in I
  </p>
  <p>
   Corinthians  15:11, Paul emphasizes that the other apostles
  </p>
  <p>
   agreed in
  </p>
  <p>
   preaching the same gospel, this same message about the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection.  This means that what the eyewitness Paul is saying
  </p>
  <p>
   is the exact same thing as what the eyewitnesses Peter and James
  </p>
  <p>
   are saying." I'll admit it: all this sounded pretty convincing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, I had some reservations about the creed, and I didn't want
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas's confident assertions to deter me from probing further.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE MYSTERY OF THE FIVE HUNDRED
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The creed in I Corinthians 15 is the only place in ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   literature where it is claimed that Jesus appeared to five
  </p>
  <p>
   hundred people at once. The gospels don't corroborate it. No
  </p>
  <p>
   secular historian mentions it. And to me, that raises a yellow
  </p>
  <p>
   flag.
  </p>
  <p>
   "If this really happened, why doesn't anyone else talk about it?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked Habermas. "You'd think the apostles would cite this as
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence  wherever they went. As the atheist Michael Martin says,
  </p>
  <p>
   'One must conclude that it is extremely unlikely that this
  </p>
  <p>
   incident really occurred' and that this therefore 'indirectly
  </p>
  <p>
   casts doubt on Paul as a reliable source.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   That remark bothered Habermas. "Well, it's just plain silliness
  </p>
  <p>
   to say this casts doubt on Paul," he replied, sounding both
  </p>
  <p>
   astonished and annoyed that someone would make that claim.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I mean, give me a break! First, even though it's only reported
  </p>
  <p>
   in one source, it just so happens to be the earliest and best-
  </p>
  <p>
   authenticated  passage of all! That counts for something.
  </p>
  <p>
   Second, Paul apparently had some proximity to these people. He
  </p>
  <p>
   says, 'most of whom are still living, though some have fallen
  </p>
  <p>
   asleep.' Paul either knew some of these people or was told by
  </p>
  <p>
   some-one who knew them that they were still walking around and
  </p>
  <p>
   willing to be interviewed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, stop and think about it: you would never include this
  </p>
  <p>
   phrase unless you were absolutely confident that these folks
  </p>
  <p>
   would confirm that they really did see Jesus alive. I mean, Paul
  </p>
  <p>
   was virtually  inviting people to check it out for themselves! He
  </p>
  <p>
   wouldn't have said this if he didn't know they'd back him up.
  </p>
  <p>
   Third, when you have only one source, you can ask, 'Why aren't
  </p>
  <p>
   there more?' But you can't say, 'This one source is crummy on the
  </p>
  <p>
   grounds that someone else didn't pick up on it.' You can't
  </p>
  <p>
   downgrade this one source that way. So this doesn't cast any
  </p>
  <p>
   doubt on Paul at all - believe me, Martin would love to be able
  </p>
  <p>
   to do that, but he can't do it legitimately.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is an example of how some critics want it both ways.
  </p>
  <p>
   Generally,  they denigrate the gospel Resurrection accounts in
  </p>
  <p>
   favor of Paul, since he is taken to be the chief authority. But
  </p>
  <p>
   on this issue, they're questioning Paul for the sake of texts
  </p>
  <p>
   that they don't trust as much in the first place! What does this
  </p>
  <p>
   say about their methodology?" I was still having trouble
  </p>
  <p>
   envisioning this appearance by Jesus to such a large crowd.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Where would this encounter with five hundred  people have taken
  </p>
  <p>
   place?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, the Galilean countryside," Habermas speculated. "If Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   could feed five thousand, he could preach to five hundred. And
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew does say Jesus appeared on a hillside; maybe more than
  </p>
  <p>
   just the eleven disciples were there."
  </p>
  <p>
   Picturing that scene in my mind, I still couldn't help but wonder
  </p>
  <p>
   why someone else didn't report on this event. "Wouldn't it be
  </p>
  <p>
   likely that the historian Josephus would have mentioned something
  </p>
  <p>
   of that magnitude?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "No, I don't think that's necessarily true. Josephus was writing
  </p>
  <p>
   sixty years afterward. How long do local stories circulate before
  </p>
  <p>
   they start to die out?" Habermas asked. "So either Josephus
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't know about it, which is possible, or he chose not to
  </p>
  <p>
   mention it, which would make sense because we know Josephus was
  </p>
  <p>
   not a follower of Jesus. You can't expect Josephus to start
  </p>
  <p>
   building the case for him." When I didn't respond for a moment,
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas continued. "Look, I'd love to have five sources for
  </p>
  <p>
   this. I don't. But I do have one excellent  source-a creed that's
  </p>
  <p>
   so good that German historian Hans von Campenhausen says, 'This
  </p>
  <p>
   account meets all the demands of historical reliability that
  </p>
  <p>
   could possibly be made of such a text.' Besides, you don't need
  </p>
  <p>
   to rely on the reference to the five hundred to make the case for
  </p>
  <p>
   the Resurrection. Usually I don't even use it."
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas's answer carried some logic. Still, there was another
  </p>
  <p>
   aspect of the creed that weighed on me: it says Jesus appeared
  </p>
  <p>
   first to Peter, whereas John said he appeared first to Mary
  </p>
  <p>
   Magdalene. In fact, the creed doesn't mention any women, even
  </p>
  <p>
   though they're prominently featured in the gospel accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Don't these contradictions hurt its credibility?" I asked. "Ah,
  </p>
  <p>
   no," came the reply. "First of all, look at the creed carefully:
  </p>
  <p>
   it doesn't say Jesus appeared first to Peter. All it does is put
  </p>
  <p>
   Peter's name first on the list. And since women were not
  </p>
  <p>
   considered competent  as witnesses in first-century Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   culture, it's not surprising that they're not mentioned here. In
  </p>
  <p>
   the first-century scheme of things, their testimony wouldn't
  </p>
  <p>
   carry any weight. So placing Peter first could indicate logical
  </p>
  <p>
   priority rather than temporal priority.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again," he concluded, "the creed's credibility remains intact.
  </p>
  <p>
   You've raised some questions, but wouldn't you concede that they
  </p>
  <p>
   don't undermine the persuasive evidence that the creed is early,
  </p>
  <p>
   that it's free from legendary contamination, that it's
  </p>
  <p>
   unambiguous and specific,  and that it's ultimately rooted in
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitness accounts?"
  </p>
  <p>
   All in all, I was forced to agree that he was right. The weight
  </p>
  <p>
   of the evidence clearly and convincingly supports the creed as
  </p>
  <p>
   being powerful evidence for Jesus' post-Resurrection appearances.
  </p>
  <p>
   So powerful that William Lane Craig, the Resurrection expert I
  </p>
  <p>
   interviewed in the previous chapter, said that Wolfhart
  </p>
  <p>
   Parmenberg, perhaps the greatest living systematic theologian in
  </p>
  <p>
   the world, "has rocked modern, skeptical German theology by
  </p>
  <p>
   building his entire theology  precisely on the historical
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence for the resurrection of Jesus as supplied in Paul's list
  </p>
  <p>
   of appearances.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having satisfied myself about the essential reliability of the I
  </p>
  <p>
   Corinthians  15 creed, it was time to begin looking at the four
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels, which recount the various appearances by the resurrected
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus in more detail.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE TESTIMONY OF THE GOSPELS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I started this line of inquiry by asking Habermas to describe the
  </p>
  <p>
   post Resurrection appearances in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
  </p>
  <p>
   "There are several different appearances to a lot of different
