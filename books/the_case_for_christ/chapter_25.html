  <p>
   With a doctorate in psychology, years of experience as a
  </p>
  <p>
   detective,  and a natural talent for understanding human
  </p>
  <p>
   behavior, Douglas has become renowned for his profiling prowess.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has coauthored several best-sellers on the topic, and when
  </p>
  <p>
   Jodie Foster won the Oscar for her performance in Silence of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Lambs, she publicly thanked Douglas  for being the real-life
  </p>
  <p>
   figure behind her character's FBI mentor. How is Douglas able to
  </p>
  <p>
   understand the thinking process of individuals  he has never even
  </p>
  <p>
   talked to? "Behavior reflects personality," Douglas explained to
  </p>
  <p>
   Biography magazine.
  </p>
  <p>
   In other words, Douglas closely examines the evidence left
  </p>
  <p>
   behind at the crime scene and, where possible, interviews victims
  </p>
  <p>
   to find out exactly what the criminal said and did. From these
  </p>
  <p>
   clues the  left-behind products of the person's behavior-he
  </p>
  <p>
   deduces the individual's psychological makeup.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Now to Jesus: without dialoguing with him, how can we possibly
  </p>
  <p>
   delve into his mind to determine what his motivations,
  </p>
  <p>
   intentions, and self-understanding were? How do we know who he
  </p>
  <p>
   thought he was and what he understood his mission to be?
  </p>
  <p>
   By looking at his behavior, Douglas would say. If we want to
  </p>
  <p>
   figure  out whether Jesus thought he was the Messiah or Son of
  </p>
  <p>
   God or  merely considered himself to be a rabbi or prophet-we
  </p>
  <p>
   need to look at what he did, what he said, and how he related to
  </p>
  <p>
   others. The question of what Jesus thought about himself is a
  </p>
  <p>
   critical issue. Some professors maintain that the myth of Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   deity was superimposed on the Jesus tradition by overzealous
  </p>
  <p>
   supporters years after his death. The real Jesus, these
  </p>
  <p>
   professors believe, would roll over in his grave if he knew
  </p>
  <p>
   people were worshiping him. If you strip away the legends and go
  </p>
  <p>
   back to the earliest material about him, they say you'll find he
  </p>
  <p>
   never aspired to be anything more than an itinerant  teacher and
  </p>
  <p>
   occasional rabble-rouser.
  </p>
  <p>
   But is the evidence of history on their side? To find out, I flew
  </p>
  <p>
   to Lexington, Kentucky, and drove the winding roads past a series
  </p>
  <p>
   of picturesque horse farms to track down the scholar whose
  </p>
  <p>
   acclaimed book The Christology of Jesus confronts this very
  </p>
  <p>
   subject.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE SIXTH INTERVIEW: BEN WITHERINGTON III, PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   There isn't much to tiny Wilmore, Kentucky, except Asbury
  </p>
  <p>
   Theological  Seminary, where I found Ben Witberington's office on
  </p>
  <p>
   the
  </p>
  <p>
   fourth floor of a colonial-style building off the rustic
  </p>
  <p>
   community's main drag. With the gracious hospitality of a
  </p>
  <p>
   Southern gentleman, the North Carolina native offered me a
  </p>
  <p>
   comfortable chair and some coffee  as we sat down to discuss who
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus of Nazareth thought he was. The topic is familiar territory
  </p>
  <p>
   to Witherington, whose books include Jesus the Sage; The Many
  </p>
  <p>
   Faces of the Christ; The Jesus Quest; Jesus, Paul, and the End of
  </p>
  <p>
   the World; and Women in the Ministry of Jesus and whose articles
  </p>
  <p>
   about Jesus have appeared in specialized dictionaries and
  </p>
  <p>
   academic journals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Educated at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary (master of
  </p>
  <p>
   divinity degree, summa cum laude) and the University of Durham in
  </p>
  <p>
   England (doctorate in theology with a concentration in New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament),  Witherington has taught at Asbury, Ashland
  </p>
  <p>
   Theological Seminary,  the Divinity School of Duke University,
  </p>
  <p>
   and Gordon-Conwell. His memberships include the Society for the
  </p>
  <p>
   Study of the New Testament, the Society of Biblical Literature,
  </p>
  <p>
   and the Institute for Biblical Research.
  </p>
  <p>
   Speaking distinctly and deliberately, weighing his words with
  </p>
  <p>
   care, Witherington definitely sounded like a scholar, yet his
  </p>
  <p>
   voice betrayed an unmistakable undercurrent of fascination-even
  </p>
  <p>
   awefor  his subject. This attitude emerged even further when he
  </p>
  <p>
   took me on a tour of a high-tech studio where he had been mixing
  </p>
  <p>
   images of Jesus with songs whose lyrics illuminate the
  </p>
  <p>
   compassion, the sacrifice,  the humanity, and the majesty of his
  </p>
  <p>
   life and ministry.
  </p>
  <p>
   For a scholar who writes heavily footnoted, cautiously nuanced,
  </p>
  <p>
   and academically precise prose on the technical issues involving
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, this artistic wedding of video and music is a poetic
  </p>
  <p>
   outlet for exploring the side of Jesus that only the creative
  </p>
  <p>
   arts can come close to capturing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Back in Witherington's office, I decided to begin examining the
  </p>
  <p>
   issue of Jesus' self-understanding with a question that often
  </p>
  <p>
   springs to the minds of readers when they're exposed to the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels for the first time.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The truth is that Jesus was a bit mysterious about his identity,
  </p>
  <p>
   wasn't he?" I asked as Witherington pulled up a chair across from
  </p>
  <p>
   me. "He tended to shy away from forthrightly proclaiming himself
  </p>
  <p>
   to be the Messiah or Son of God. Was that because he didn't think
  </p>
  <p>
   of himself in those terms or because he had other reasons?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "No, it's not because he didn't think of himself in those terms,"
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington said as he settled into his chair and crossed his
  </p>
  <p>
   legs. "If he had simply announced, 'Hi, folks; I'm God,' that
  </p>
  <p>
   would have been heard as 'I'm Yahweh,' because the Jews of his
  </p>
  <p>
   day didn't have any concept of the Trinity. They only knew of God
  </p>
  <p>
   the Father-whom they called Yahweh-and not God the Son or God the
  </p>
  <p>
   Holy Spirit. So if someone were to say he was God, that wouldn't
  </p>
  <p>
   have made any sense to them and would have been seen as clear-cut
  </p>
  <p>
   blasphemy. And it would have been counterproductive to Jesus in
  </p>
  <p>
   his efforts to get people to listen to his message.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides, there were already a host of expectations about what the
  </p>
  <p>
   Messiah would look like, and Jesus didn't want to be pigeon-holed
  </p>
  <p>
   into somebody else's categories. Consequently, he was very
  </p>
  <p>
   careful about what he said publicly. In private with his
  </p>
  <p>
   disciples-that was a different story, but the gospels primarily
  </p>
  <p>
   tell us about what he did in public."
  </p>
  <h2>
   EXPLORING THE EARLIEST TRADITIONS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   It was a 1977 book by British theologian John Hick and half a
  </p>
  <p>
   dozen like-minded colleagues that prompted a firestonn of
  </p>
  <p>
   controversy by charging that Jesus never thought of himself as
  </p>
  <p>
   God incarnate or the Messiah. These concepts, they wrote,
  </p>
  <p>
   developed later and were written  into the gospels so it appeared
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus was making these claims about himself
  </p>
  <p>
   To explore that allegation, Witherington has gone back to the
  </p>
  <p>
   very earliest traditions about Jesus-the most primitive material,
  </p>
  <p>
   unquestionably  safe from legendary development-and discovered
  </p>
  <p>
   persuasive
  </p>
  <p>
   clues concerning how Jesus really regarded himself.
  </p>
  <p>
   I wanted to delve into that research, starting with this
  </p>
  <p>
   question: "What clues can we find about Jesus' self-understanding
  </p>
  <p>
   from the way he related to others?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington thought for a moment, then replied, "Look at his
  </p>
  <p>
   relationship with his disciples. Jesus has twelve disciples, yet
  </p>
  <p>
   notice that he's not one of the Twelve."
  </p>
  <p>
   While that may sound like a detail without a difference,
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington  said it's quite significant.
  </p>
  <p>
   "If the Twelve represent a renewed Israel, where does Jesus fit
  </p>
  <p>
   in?" he asked. "He's not just part of Israel, not merely part of
  </p>
  <p>
   the redeemed group, he's forming the group-just as God in the Old
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament  formed his people and set up the twelve tribes of
  </p>
  <p>
   Israel. That's a clue about what Jesus thought of himself."
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington went on to describe a clue that can be found in
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' relationship with John the Baptist. "Jesus says, 'Of all
  </p>
  <p>
   people born of woman, John is the greatest man on earth.' Having
  </p>
  <p>
   said that, he then goes even further in his ministry than the
  </p>
  <p>
   Baptist did-by doing miracles, for example. What does that say
  </p>
  <p>
   about what he thinks of himself?
  </p>
  <p>
   And his relationship with the religious leaders is perhaps the
  </p>
  <p>
   most revealing. Jesus makes the truly radical statement that it's
  </p>
  <p>
   not what enters a person that defiles him but what comes out of
  </p>
  <p>
   his heart. Frankly, this sets aside huge portions of the Old
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament book of Leviticus, with its meticulous rules concerning
  </p>
  <p>
   purity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, the Pharisees didn't like this message. They wanted to keep
  </p>
  <p>
   things as they were, but Jesus said, 'No, God has further plans.
  </p>
  <p>
   He's doing a new thing.' We have to ask, What kind of person
  </p>
  <p>
   thinks he has the authority to set aside the divinely inspired
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish Scriptures  and supplant them with his own teaching?
  </p>
  <p>
   And what about his relationship-if we can call it that-with the
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman authorities? We have to ask why they crucified him. If he
  </p>
  <p>
   had merely been an innocuous sage telling nice little parables,
  </p>
  <p>
   how did he end up on a cross, especially at a Passover season,
  </p>
  <p>
   when no Jew wants any Jew to be executed? There had to be a
  </p>
  <p>
   reason why the sign above his head said, 'This is the King of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jews.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington let that last comment hang in the air, before
  </p>
  <p>
   providing  the explanation himself: "Either Jesus had made that
  </p>
  <p>
   verbal claim," he said, "or someone clearly thought he did."
  </p>
  <h2>
   BY THE FINGER OF GOD
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While Jesus' relationships provide one window into his self-
  </p>
  <p>
   understanding,  Witherington said that Jesus' deeds-especially
  </p>
  <p>
   his miracles-offer  additional insights. However, I raised my
  </p>
  <p>
   hand to stop him. "Certainly you can't say that Jesus' miracles
  </p>
  <p>
   establish that he thought he was God," I said, "since later his
  </p>
  <p>
   own disciples went out and did the same things-and certainly they
  </p>
  <p>
   weren't making claims of deity."
  </p>
  <p>
   "No, it's not the fact that Jesus did miracles that illuminates
  </p>
  <p>
   his self-understanding," replied Witherington. "What's important
  </p>
  <p>
   is how he interprets his miracles."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What do you mean?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Jesus says, 'If 1, by the finger of God, cast out demons, then
  </p>
  <p>
   you will know that the kingdom of God has come upon you.' He's
  </p>
  <p>
   not like other miracle workers who do amazing things and then
  </p>
  <p>
   life proceeds as it always has. No-to Jesus, his miracles are a
  </p>
  <p>
   sign indicating the coming of the kingdom of God. They are a
  </p>
  <p>
   foretaste of what the kingdom  is going to be like. And that sets
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus apart."
  </p>
  <p>
   Again I interrupted. "Elaborate on that a bit," I said. "How does
  </p>
  <p>
   it set him apart?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Jesus sees his miracles as bringing about something
  </p>
  <p>
   unprecedented-the  coming of God's dominion," replied
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington. "He
  </p>
  <p>
   doesn't merely see himself as a worker of miracles; he sees
  </p>
  <p>
   himself as the one in whom and through whom the promises of God
  </p>
  <p>
   come to pass. And that's a not-too-thinly-veiled claim of
  </p>
  <p>
   transcendence." I nodded. Now his point made sense to me. With
  </p>
  <p>
   that I turned to the words- 'of Jesus, in search of more clues
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning his selfunderstanding.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "He was called Rabbouni, or 'Rabbi,' by his followers," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Doesn't this imply that he merely taught like the other rabbis
  </p>
  <p>
   of his day?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington grinned. "Actually," he said, "Jesus taught in a
  </p>
  <p>
   radical  new way. He begins his teachings with the phrase 'Amen I
  </p>
  <p>
   say to you,' which is to say, 'I swear in advance to the
  </p>
  <p>
   truthfulness of what I'm about to say.' This was absolutely
  </p>
  <p>
   revolutionary."
  </p>
  <p>
   "How so?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   He replied, "In Judaism you needed the testimony of two
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses, so witness A could witness the truth of witness B and
  </p>
  <p>
   vice versa. But Jesus witnesses to the truth of his own sayings.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead of basing his teaching on the authority of others, he
  </p>
  <p>
   speaks on his own authority. "So here is someone who considered
  </p>
  <p>
   himself to have authority above and beyond what the Old Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   prophets had. He believed he possessed not only divine
  </p>
  <p>
   inspiration, as King David did, but also divine authority and the
  </p>
  <p>
   power of direct divine utterance." In addition to employing the
  </p>
  <p>
   "Amen" phrase in his teaching, Jesus used the term "Abba" when he
  </p>
  <p>
   was relating to God. "What does that tell us about what he
  </p>
  <p>
   thought about himself?" I asked. "'Abba' connotes intimacy in a
