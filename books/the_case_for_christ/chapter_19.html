   be exactly right." Another example is Luke's reference in Acts 17:6 to "politarchs," which is translated as "city officials" by the NIV, in the city of Thessalonica.  "For a long time people thought Luke was mistaken, because no evidence of the term 'politarchs' had been found in any ancient Roman documents," McRay said. "However, an inscription on a first-century arch was later found that begins, 'In the time of the politarchs . . .' You can go to the British Museum and see it for yourself. And then, lo and behold, archaeologists  have found more than thirty-five inscriptions that mention politarchs, several of these in Thessalonica from the same period Luke was referring to. Once again the critics were wrong and Luke was shown to be right." An objection popped into my mind. "Yes, but in his gospel Luke says that Jesus was walking into Jericho when he healed the blind man Bartimaeus, while Mark says he was coming out of Jericho.' Isn't this a clear-cut contradiction that casts doubt on the reliability of the New Testament?" McRay wasn't stung by the directness of my question. "Not at all," came his response. "It only appears to be a contradiction because you're thinking in contemporary terms, in which cities are built and stay put. But that wasn't necessarily the case long ago. Jericho was in at least four different locations as much as a quarter  of a mile apart in ancient times. The city was destroyed and resettled  near another water supply or a new road or nearer a mountain or whatever. The point is, you can be coming out of one site where Jericho  existed and be going into another one, like moving from one part of suburban Chicago to another part of suburban Chicago." "What you're saying is that both Luke and Mark- could be right?" I asked. "That's correct. Jesus could have been going out of one area of Jericho and into another at the same time." Again archaeology had answered another challenge to Luke. And given the large portion of the New Testament written by him, it's extremely significant that Luke has been established to be a scrupulously accurate historian, even in the smallest details. One prominent archaeologist carefully examined Luke's references to thirty-two countries, fifty-four cities, and nine islands, finding not a single mistake. Here's the bottom line: "If Luke was so painstakingly accurate in his historical reporting," said one book on the topic, "on what logical basis may we assume he was credulous or inaccurate in his reporting of matters that were far more important, not only to him but to others as well?" Matters, for example, like the resurrection of Jesus, the most influential evidence of his deity, which Luke says was firmly established  by "many convincing proofs" (Acts 1:3).
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE RELIABILITY OF JOHN AND MARK
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Archaeology may support the credibility of Luke, but he isn't the only author of the New Testament. I wondered what scientists would have to say about John, whose gospel was sometimes considered suspect because he talked about locations that couldn't be verified. Some scholars charged that since he failed to get these basic details straight, John must not have been close to the events of Jesus' life. That conclusion, however, has been turned upside down in recent years. "There have been several discoveries that have shown John to be very accurate," McRay pointed out. "For example, John 5:1-15 records how Jesus healed an invalid by the Pool of Bethesda. John provides the detail that the pool had five porticoes. For a long time people cited this as an example of John being inaccurate, because no such place had been found. But more recently the Pool of Bethesda has been excavated - it lies maybe forty feet below ground-and sure enough, there were five porticoes, which means colonnaded porches or walkways, exactly as John had described. And you have other discoveries-the Pool of Siloam from John 9:7. Jacob's Well from John 4:12, the probable location  of the Stone Pavement near the Jaffa Gate where Jesus appeared before Pilate in John 19:13, even Pilate's own identity-all of which have lent historical credibility to John's gospel." "So this challenges the allegation that the gospel of John was written  so long after Jesus that it can't possibly be accurate," I said. "Most definitely," he replied. In fact, McRay reiterated what Dr. Bruce Metzger had told me about archaeologists finding a fragment of a copy of John 18 that leading papyrologists have dated to about A.D. 125. By demonstrating  that copies of John existed this early and as far away as Egypt, archaeology has effectively dismantled speculation that John had been composed well into the second century, too long after Jesus' life to be reliable. Other scholars have attacked the gospel of Mark, generally considered  the first account of Jesus' life to be written. Atheist Michael Martin accuses Mark of being ignorant about Palestinian geography, which he says demonstrates that he could not have lived in the region at the time of Jesus. Specifically he cites Mark 7:31: "Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis." It has been pointed out," said Martin, "that given these directions  Jesus would have been traveling directly away from the Sea of Galilee." When I posed Martin's critique to McRay, he furrowed his brow and then went into a flurry of activity, pulling a Greek version of Mark off his shelf, grabbing reference books, and unfolding large maps of ancient Palestine. "What these critics seem to be assuming is that Jesus is getting in his car and zipping around on an interstate, but he obviously wasn't," he said. Reading the text in the original language, taking into account the mountainous terrain and probable roads of the region, and considering  the loose way "Decapolis" was used to refer to a confederation  of ten cities that varied from time to time, McRay traced a logical route on the map that corresponded precisely with Mark's description. "When everything is put into the appropriate context," he concluded,  "there's no problem with Mark's account." Again archaeological insights had helped explain what appeared at first to be a sticking point in the New Testament. I asked McRay a broad question about that: had he ever encountered an archaeological  finding that blatantly contravened a New Testament reference? He shook his head. "Archaeology has not produced anything that is unequivocally a contradiction to the Bible," he replied with confidence.  "On the contrary, as we've seen, there have been many opinions  of skeptical scholars that have become codified into 'fact' over the years but that archaeology has shown to be wrong." Still, there were some matters I needed to resolve. I pulled out my notes and got ready to challenge McRay with three long- standing riddles  that I thought archaeology might have some trouble explaining.
  </p>
  <h2>
   PUZZLE 1: THE CENSUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The birth narratives of Jesus claim that Mary and Joseph were required by a census to return to Joseph's hometown of Bethlehem. "Let me be blunt: this seems absurd on the face of it," I said. "How could the government possibly force all its citizens to return to their birthplace? Is there any archaeological evidence whatsoever that this kind of census ever took place?" McRay calmly pulled out a copy of his book. "Actually, the discovery  of ancient census forms has shed quite a bit of light on this practice," he said as he leafed through the pages. Finding the reference  he was searching for, he quoted from an official governmental order dated A.D. 104. Gaius Vibius Maximus, Prefect of Egypt [says]: Seeing that the time has come for the house to house census, it is necessary to compel all those who for any cause whatsoever are residing out of their provinces to return to their own homes, that they may both carry out the regular order of the census and may also attend diligently to the cultivation of their allotments .6 "As you can see," he said as he closed the book, "that practice is confirmed by this document, even though this particular manner of counting people might seem odd to you. And another papyrus, this one from A.D. 48, indicates that the entire family was involved in the census. 9 This, however, did not entirely dispose of the issue. Luke said the census that brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem was conducted  when Quirinius was governing Syria and during the reign of Herod the Great. "That poses a significant problem," I pointed out, "because Herod died in 4 B.C., and Quirinius didn't begin ruling Syria until A.D. 6, conducting the census soon after that. There's a big gap there; how can you deal with such a major discrepancy in the dates?" McRay knew I was raising an issue that archaeologists have wrestled with for years. He responded by saying, "An eminent archaeologist named Jerry Vardaman has done a great deal of work in this regard. He has found a coin with the name of Quirinius on it in very small writing, or what we call 'micrographic' letters. This Places him as proconsul of Syria and Cilicia from 11 B.C. until after the death of Herod."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I was confused. "What does that mean?" I asked. "It means that there were apparently two Quiriniuses," he replied. "It's not uncommon to have lots of people with the same Roman names, so there's no reason to doubt that there were two people by the name of Quirinius. The census would have taken place under the reign of the earlier Quirinius. Given the cycle of a census every fourteen years, that would work out quite well." This sounded a bit speculative to me, but rather than bog down this conversation, I decided to mentally file this issue away for further  analysis later. When I did some additional research, I found that Sir William Ramsay, the late archaeologist and professor at both Oxford and Cambridge  Universities in England, had come up with a similar theory. He concluded from various inscriptions that while there was only one Quirinius, he ruled Syria on two separate occasions, which would cover the time period of the earlier census. Other scholars have pointed out that Luke's text can be translated,  "This census took place before Quirinius was governing Syria," which would also resolve the problem. The matter was not as precisely pinned down as I would like. However, I had to admit that McRay and others had offered some plausible explanations. I could conclude with confidence that censuses  were held during the time frame of Jesus' birth and that there is evidence people were indeed required to return to their hometowns-which  I still thought was odd!

  <h2>
   PUZZLE 2: EXISTENCE OF NAZARETH
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Many Christians are unaware that skeptics have been asserting for a long time that Nazareth never existed during the time when the New Testament says Jesus spent his childhood there. n an article called "Where Jesus Never Walked," atheist Frank Zindler noted that Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament, by the apostle Paul, by the Talmud (although sixty- three other Galilean towns are cited), or by Josephus (who listed forty-five other villages and cities of Galilee, including Japha, which was located just over a mile from present-day Nazareth).
