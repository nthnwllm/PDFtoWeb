   </ul>
  </nav>
  <p>
   be
  </p>
  <p>
   exactly right."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Another example is Luke's reference in Acts 17:6 to "politarchs,"
  </p>
  <p>
   which is translated as "city officials" by the NIV, in the city
  </p>
  <p>
   of Thessalonica.  "For a long time people thought Luke was
  </p>
  <p>
   mistaken,
  </p>
  <p>
   because no evidence of the term 'politarchs' had been found in
  </p>
  <p>
   any ancient Roman documents," McRay said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "However, an inscription on a first-century arch was later found
  </p>
  <p>
   that begins, 'In the time of the politarchs . . .' You can go to
  </p>
  <p>
   the British Museum and see it for yourself. And then, lo and
  </p>
  <p>
   behold, archaeologists  have found more than thirty-five
  </p>
  <p>
   inscriptions that mention politarchs, several of these in
  </p>
  <p>
   Thessalonica from the same period Luke was referring to. Once
  </p>
  <p>
   again the critics were wrong and Luke was shown to be right."
  </p>
  <p>
   An objection popped into my mind. "Yes, but in his gospel Luke
  </p>
  <p>
   says that Jesus was walking into Jericho when he healed the blind
  </p>
  <p>
   man Bartimaeus, while Mark says he was coming out of Jericho.'
  </p>
  <p>
   Isn't this a clear-cut contradiction that casts doubt on the
  </p>
  <p>
   reliability of the New Testament?"
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay wasn't stung by the directness of my question. "Not at
  </p>
  <p>
   all," came his response. "It only appears to be a contradiction
  </p>
  <p>
   because you're thinking in contemporary terms, in which cities
  </p>
  <p>
   are built and stay put. But that wasn't necessarily the case long
  </p>
  <p>
   ago. Jericho was in at least four different locations as much as
  </p>
  <p>
   a quarter  of a mile apart in ancient times. The city was
  </p>
  <p>
   destroyed and resettled  near another water supply or a new road
  </p>
  <p>
   or nearer a mountain or whatever. The point is, you can be coming
  </p>
  <p>
   out of one site where Jericho  existed and be going into another
  </p>
  <p>
   one, like moving from one part of suburban Chicago to another
  </p>
  <p>
   part of suburban Chicago."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What you're saying is that both Luke and Mark- could be right?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "That's correct. Jesus could have been going out of one area of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jericho and into another at the same time."
  </p>
  <p>
   Again archaeology had answered another challenge to Luke.
  </p>
  <p>
   And given the large portion of the New Testament written by him,
  </p>
  <p>
   it's extremely significant that Luke has been established to be a
  </p>
  <p>
   scrupulously accurate historian, even in the smallest details.
  </p>
  <p>
   One prominent archaeologist carefully examined Luke's references
  </p>
  <p>
   to thirty-two countries, fifty-four cities, and nine islands,
  </p>
  <p>
   finding not a single mistake.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Here's the bottom line: "If Luke was so painstakingly accurate in
  </p>
  <p>
   his historical reporting," said one book on the topic, "on what
  </p>
  <p>
   logical basis may we assume he was credulous or inaccurate in his
  </p>
  <p>
   reporting of matters that were far more important, not only to
  </p>
  <p>
   him but to others as well?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Matters, for example, like the resurrection of Jesus, the most
  </p>
  <p>
   influential evidence of his deity, which Luke says was firmly
  </p>
  <p>
   established  by "many convincing proofs" (Acts 1:3).
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE RELIABILITY OF JOHN AND MARK
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Archaeology may support the credibility of Luke, but he isn't the
  </p>
  <p>
   only author of the New Testament. I wondered what scientists
  </p>
  <p>
   would have to say about John, whose gospel was sometimes
  </p>
  <p>
   considered suspect because he talked about locations that
  </p>
  <p>
   couldn't be verified. Some scholars charged that since he failed
  </p>
  <p>
   to get these basic details straight, John must not have been
  </p>
  <p>
   close to the events of Jesus' life. That conclusion, however, has
  </p>
  <p>
   been turned upside down in recent years. "There have been several
  </p>
  <p>
   discoveries that have shown John to be very accurate," McRay
  </p>
  <p>
   pointed out. "For example, John 5:1-15 records how Jesus healed
  </p>
  <p>
   an invalid by the Pool of Bethesda. John provides the detail that
  </p>
  <p>
   the pool had five porticoes. For a long time people cited this as
  </p>
  <p>
   an example of John being inaccurate, because no such place had
  </p>
  <p>
   been found.
  </p>
  <p>
   But more recently the Pool of Bethesda has been excavated - it
  </p>
  <p>
   lies maybe forty feet below ground-and sure enough, there were
  </p>
  <p>
   five porticoes, which means colonnaded porches or walkways,
  </p>
  <p>
   exactly as John had described. And you have other discoveries-the
  </p>
  <p>
   Pool of Siloam from John 9:7. Jacob's Well from John 4:12, the
  </p>
  <p>
   probable location  of the Stone Pavement near the Jaffa Gate
  </p>
  <p>
   where Jesus appeared before Pilate in John 19:13, even Pilate's
  </p>
  <p>
   own identity-all of which have lent historical credibility to
  </p>
  <p>
   John's gospel."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So this challenges the allegation that the gospel of John was
  </p>
  <p>
   written  so long after Jesus that it can't possibly be accurate,"
  </p>
  <p>
   I said. "Most definitely," he replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, McRay reiterated what Dr. Bruce Metzger had told me
  </p>
  <p>
   about archaeologists finding a fragment of a copy of John 18 that
  </p>
  <p>
   leading papyrologists have dated to about A.D. 125. By
  </p>
  <p>
   demonstrating  that copies of John existed this early and as far
  </p>
  <p>
   away as Egypt, archaeology has effectively dismantled speculation
  </p>
  <p>
   that John had been composed well into the second century, too
  </p>
  <p>
   long after Jesus' life to be reliable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other scholars have attacked the gospel of Mark, generally
  </p>
  <p>
   considered  the first account of Jesus' life to be written.
  </p>
  <p>
   Atheist Michael Martin accuses Mark of being ignorant about
  </p>
  <p>
   Palestinian geography, which he says demonstrates that he could
  </p>
  <p>
   not have lived in the region at the time of Jesus. Specifically
  </p>
  <p>
   he cites Mark 7:31: "Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and
  </p>
  <p>
   went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the
  </p>
  <p>
   region of the Decapolis."
  </p>
  <p>
   It has been pointed out," said Martin, "that given these
  </p>
  <p>
   directions  Jesus would have been traveling directly away from
  </p>
  <p>
   the Sea of Galilee."
  </p>
  <p>
   When I posed Martin's critique to McRay, he furrowed his brow and
  </p>
  <p>
   then went into a flurry of activity, pulling a Greek version of
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark off his shelf, grabbing reference books, and unfolding large
  </p>
  <p>
   maps of ancient Palestine.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What these critics seem to be assuming is that Jesus is getting
  </p>
  <p>
   in his car and zipping around on an interstate, but he obviously
  </p>
  <p>
   wasn't," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Reading the text in the original language, taking into account
  </p>
  <p>
   the mountainous terrain and probable roads of the region, and
  </p>
  <p>
   considering  the loose way "Decapolis" was used to refer to a
  </p>
  <p>
   confederation  of ten cities that varied from time to time, McRay
  </p>
  <p>
   traced a logical route on the map that corresponded precisely
  </p>
  <p>
   with Mark's description.
  </p>
  <p>
   "When everything is put into the appropriate context," he
  </p>
  <p>
   concluded,  "there's no problem with Mark's account."
  </p>
  <p>
   Again archaeological insights had helped explain what appeared at
  </p>
  <p>
   first to be a sticking point in the New Testament. I asked McRay
  </p>
  <p>
   a broad question about that: had he ever encountered an
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeological  finding that blatantly contravened a New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament reference? He shook his head. "Archaeology has not
  </p>
  <p>
   produced anything that is unequivocally a contradiction to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible," he replied with confidence.  "On the contrary, as we've
  </p>
  <p>
   seen, there have been many opinions  of skeptical scholars that
  </p>
  <p>
   have become codified into 'fact' over the years but that
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeology has shown to be wrong."
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, there were some matters I needed to resolve. I pulled out
  </p>
  <p>
   my notes and got ready to challenge McRay with three long-
  </p>
  <p>
   standing riddles  that I thought archaeology might have some
  </p>
  <p>
   trouble explaining.
  </p>
  <h2>
   PUZZLE 1: THE CENSUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The birth narratives of Jesus claim that Mary and Joseph were
  </p>
  <p>
   required by a census to return to Joseph's hometown of Bethlehem.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me be blunt: this seems absurd on the face of it," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "How could the government possibly force all its citizens to
  </p>
  <p>
   return to their birthplace? Is there any archaeological evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   whatsoever that this kind of census ever took place?"
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay calmly pulled out a copy of his book. "Actually, the
  </p>
  <p>
   discovery  of ancient census forms has shed quite a bit of light
  </p>
  <p>
   on this practice," he said as he leafed through the pages.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finding the reference  he was searching for, he quoted from an
  </p>
  <p>
   official governmental order dated A.D. 104.
  </p>
  <p>
   Gaius Vibius Maximus, Prefect of Egypt [says]: Seeing that the
  </p>
  <p>
   time has come for the house to house census, it is necessary to
  </p>
  <p>
   compel all those who for any cause whatsoever are residing
  </p>
  <p>
   out of their provinces to return to their own homes, that they
  </p>
  <p>
   may both carry out the regular order of the census and may
  </p>
  <p>
   also attend diligently to the cultivation of their allotments .6
  </p>
  <p>
   "As you can see," he said as he closed the book, "that practice
  </p>
  <p>
   is confirmed by this document, even though this particular manner
  </p>
  <p>
   of counting people might seem odd to you. And another papyrus,
  </p>
  <p>
   this one from A.D. 48, indicates that the entire family was
  </p>
  <p>
   involved in the census. 9
  </p>
  <p>
   This, however, did not entirely dispose of the issue. Luke said
  </p>
  <p>
   the census that brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem was
  </p>
  <p>
   conducted  when Quirinius was governing Syria and during the
  </p>
  <p>
   reign of Herod the Great.
  </p>
  <p>
   "That poses a significant problem," I pointed out, "because Herod
  </p>
  <p>
   died in 4 B.C., and Quirinius didn't begin ruling Syria until
  </p>
  <p>
   A.D. 6, conducting the census soon after that. There's a big gap
  </p>
  <p>
   there; how can you deal with such a major discrepancy in the

   dates?" McRay knew I was raising an issue that archaeologists
  </p>
  <p>
   have
  </p>
  <p>
   wrestled with for years. He responded by saying, "An eminent
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeologist named Jerry Vardaman has done a great deal of work
  </p>
  <p>
   in this regard. He has found a coin with the name of Quirinius on
  </p>
  <p>
   it in very small writing, or what we call 'micrographic' letters.
  </p>
  <p>
   This Places him as proconsul of Syria and Cilicia from 11 B.C.
  </p>
  <p>
   until after the death of Herod."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I was confused. "What does that mean?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It means that there were apparently two Quiriniuses," he
  </p>
  <p>
   replied. "It's not uncommon to have lots of people with the same
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman names, so there's no reason to doubt that there were two
  </p>
  <p>
   people by the name of Quirinius. The census would have taken
  </p>
  <p>
   place under the reign of the earlier Quirinius. Given the cycle
  </p>
  <p>
   of a census every fourteen years, that would work out quite
  </p>
  <p>
   well."
  </p>
  <p>
   This sounded a bit speculative to me, but rather than bog down
  </p>
  <p>
   this conversation, I decided to mentally file this issue away for
  </p>
  <p>
   further  analysis later.
  </p>
  <p>
   When I did some additional research, I found that Sir William
  </p>
  <p>
   Ramsay, the late archaeologist and professor at both Oxford and
  </p>
  <p>
   Cambridge  Universities in England, had come up with a similar
  </p>
  <p>
   theory. He concluded from various inscriptions that while there
  </p>
  <p>
   was only one Quirinius, he ruled Syria on two separate occasions,
  </p>
  <p>
   which would cover the time period of the earlier census.
  </p>
  <p>
   Other scholars have pointed out that Luke's text can be
  </p>
  <p>
   translated,  "This census took place before Quirinius was
  </p>
  <p>
   governing Syria," which would also resolve the problem.
  </p>
  <p>
   The matter was not as precisely pinned down as I would like.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, I had to admit that McRay and others had offered some
  </p>
  <p>
   plausible explanations. I could conclude with confidence that
  </p>
  <p>
   censuses  were held during the time frame of Jesus' birth and
  </p>
  <p>
   that there is evidence people were indeed required to return to
  </p>
  <p>
   their hometowns-which  I still thought was odd!

   PUZZLE 2: EXISTENCE OF NAZARETH
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Many Christians are unaware that skeptics have been asserting for
  </p>
  <p>
   a long time that Nazareth never existed during the time when the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament says Jesus spent his childhood there.
  </p>
  <p>
   n an article called "Where Jesus Never Walked," atheist Frank
  </p>
  <p>
   Zindler noted that Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament, by the apostle Paul, by the Talmud (although sixty-
  </p>
  <p>
   three other Galilean towns are cited), or by Josephus (who listed
  </p>
  <p>
   forty-five other villages and cities of Galilee, including Japha,
  </p>
  <p>
   which was located just over a mile from present-day Nazareth). No
