   Ask Timothy McVeigh. He may have thought he committed the
  </p>
  <p>
   perfect crime by avoiding eyewitnesses, but he nevertheless
  </p>
  <p>
   landed on death row due to the circumstantial facts that pointed
  </p>
  <p>
   toward him as devastatingly as any firsthand witness could have.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having already considered the persuasive evidence for the empty
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb, and eyewitness accounts of the risen Jesus, now it was time
  </p>
  <p>
   for me to seek out any circumstantial evidence that might bolster
  </p>
  <p>
   the case for the Resurrection. I knew that if an event as
  </p>
  <p>
   extraordinary as the resurrection of Jesus had really occurred,
  </p>
  <p>
   history would be littered  with indirect evidence backing it up.
  </p>
  <p>
   That quest took me once more to southern California, this time to
  </p>
  <p>
   the office of a professor who masterfully blends expertise in
  </p>
  <p>
   history, philosophy, and science.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE THIRTEENTH INTERVIEW: J. P. MORELAND, PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   J. P. Moreland's dark-gray hair, silvery mustache, and gold-
  </p>
  <p>
   rimmed glasses make him appear a little older than his fifty
  </p>
  <p>
   years. Yet he is brimming with energy. He spoke in animated and
  </p>
  <p>
   enthusiastic tones, frequently leaning forward in his swivel
  </p>
  <p>
   chair to emphasize his points, actually bouncing a bit at times,
  </p>
  <p>
   almost as if he were going to leap out and throttle me with his
  </p>
  <p>
   arguments.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I love this stuff," he exclaimed during one brief break-the only
  </p>
  <p>
   time during our conversation when he stated the obvious.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreland's highly organized mind works so systematically, so
  </p>
  <p>
   logically, that he seems to effortlessly construct his case in
  </p>
  <p>
   complete sentences and whole paragraphs, without wasted words or
  </p>
  <p>
   extraneous  thoughts, ready for proofreading and printing. When
  </p>
  <p>
   my tape recorder would stop, he would pause, give me time to slip
  </p>
  <p>
   in a new cassette, and then pick up exactly where he had left
  </p>
  <p>
   off, without missing a beat.
  </p>
  <p>
   While Moreland is a well-known philosopher (with a doctorate from
  </p>
  <p>
   the University of Southern California) and is comfortable
  </p>
  <p>
   navigating  the conceptual worlds of Kant and Kierkegaard, he
  </p>
  <p>
   doesn't
  </p>
  <p>
   dwell exclusively in the abstract. His background in science (he
  </p>
  <p>
   has a chemistry degree from the University of Missouri) and
  </p>
  <p>
   mastery of history (as demonstrated by his excellent book Scaling
  </p>
  <p>
   the Secular City) anchor him in the everyday world and prevent
  </p>
  <p>
   him from floating  into purely ethereal thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreland, who also has a master's degree in theology from Dallas
  </p>
  <p>
   Theological Seminary, currently is a professor at the Talbot
  </p>
  <p>
   School of Theology, where he teaches in the master's program in
  </p>
  <p>
   philosophy and ethics.
  </p>
  <p>
   His articles have been published in more than thirty professional
  </p>
  <p>
   journals, such as American Philosophical Quarterly,
  </p>
  <p>
   Metaphilosophy; and Philosophy and Phenomeological Research. He
  </p>
  <p>
   has written, coauthored,  or edited a dozen books, including
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity and the Nature of Science; Does God Exist? (a debate
  </p>
  <p>
   with Kai Nielsen); The Life and Death Debate; The Creation
  </p>
  <p>
   Hypothesis; Beyond Death: Exploring the Evidence for Immortality;
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus under Fire; and Love Your God with All Your Mind.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sitting down with Moreland in his small but homey office, I
  </p>
  <p>
   already knew that circumstantial evidence is plural rather than
  </p>
  <p>
   singular.  In other words, it's built brick by brick by brick
  </p>
  <p>
   until there's a sturdy foundation on which conclusions can be
  </p>
  <p>
   confidently based. So I began our interview with a point-blank
  </p>
  <p>
   challenge: "Can you give me five pieces of circumstantial
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence that convince you Jesus rose from the dead?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreland listened intently to my question. "Five examples?" he
  </p>
  <p>
   asked. "Five things that are not in dispute by anybody?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I nodded. With that Moreland pushed his chair back from his desk
  </p>
  <p>
   and launched into his first piece of evidence: the changed lives
  </p>
  <p>
   of the disciples and their willingness to die for their
  </p>
  <p>
   conviction that Jesus had risen from the dead.
  </p>
  <h2>
   EXHIBIT 1: THE DISCIPLES DIED FOR THEIR BELIEFS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "When Jesus was crucified," Moreland began, "his followers were
  </p>
  <p>
   discouraged and depressed. They no longer had confidence that
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus had been sent by God, because they believed anyone
  </p>
  <p>
   crucified was accursed by God. They also had been taught that God
  </p>
  <p>
   would not let his Messiah suffer death. So they dispersed. The
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus movement was all but stopped in its tracks.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, after a short period of time, we see them abandoning their
  </p>
  <p>
   occupations, regathering, and committing themselves to spreading
  </p>
  <p>
   a very specific message-that Jesus Christ was the Messiah of God
  </p>
  <p>
   who died on a cross, returned to life, and was seen alive by
  </p>
  <p>
   them. And they were willing to spend the rest of their lives
  </p>
  <p>
   proclaiming  this, without any payoff from a human point of view.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's not as though there were a mansion awaiting them on the
  </p>
  <p>
   Mediterranean. They faced a life of hardship. They often went
  </p>
  <p>
   without food, slept exposed to the elements, were ridiculed,
  </p>
  <p>
   beaten, imprisoned. And finally, most of them were executed in
  </p>
  <p>
   torturous ways.
  </p>
  <p>
   For what? For good intentions? No, because they were convinced
  </p>
  <p>
   beyond a shadow of a doubt that they had seen Jesus Christ alive
  </p>
  <p>
   from the dead. What you can't explain is how this particular
  </p>
  <p>
   group of men came up with this particular belief without having
  </p>
  <p>
   had an experience of the resurrected Christ. There's no other
  </p>
  <p>
   adequate explanation." I interrupted with a "Yes, but . . ."
  </p>
  <p>
   objection. "Yes," I agreed, "they were willing to die for their
  </p>
  <p>
   beliefs. But," I added, "so have Muslims and Mormons and
  </p>
  <p>
   followers of Jim Jones and David Koresh. This may show that they
  </p>
  <p>
   were fanatical, but let's face it: it doesn't prove that what
  </p>
  <p>
   they believed is true."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Wait a minute-think carefully about the difference," Moreland
  </p>
  <p>
   insisted as he swiveled to face me head-on, planting both of his
  </p>
  <p>
   feet firmly on the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Muslims might be willing to die for their belief that Allah
  </p>
  <p>
   revealed himself to Muhammad, but this revelation was not done in
  </p>
  <p>
   a publicly observable way. So they could be wrong about it. They
  </p>
  <p>
   may sincerely think it's true, but they can't know for a fact,
  </p>
  <p>
   because they didn't witness it themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
   "However, the apostles were willing to die for something they had
  </p>
  <p>
   seen with their own eyes and touched with their own hands. They
  </p>
  <p>
   were in a unique position not to just believe Jesus rose from the
  </p>
  <p>
   dead but to know for sure. And when you've got eleven credible
  </p>
  <p>
   people with no ulterior motives, with nothing to gain and a lot
  </p>
  <p>
   to lose, who all agree they observed something with their own
  </p>
  <p>
   eyes-now you've got some difficulty explaining that away."
  </p>
  <p>
   I smiled because I had been playing devil's advocate by raising
  </p>
  <p>
   my objection. Actually, I knew he was right. In fact, this
  </p>
  <p>
   critical distinction  was pivotal in my own spiritual journey.
  </p>
  <p>
   It had been put to me this way: People will die for their
  </p>
  <p>
   religious beliefs if they sincerely believe they're true, but
  </p>
  <p>
   people won't die for their religious beliefs if they know their
  </p>
  <p>
   beliefs are false. While most people can only have faith that
  </p>
  <p>
   their beliefs are true, the disciples were in a position to know
  </p>
  <p>
   without a doubt whether or not Jesus had risen from the dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   They claimed that they saw him, talked with him, and ate with
  </p>
  <p>
   him. If they weren't absolutely certain, they wouldn't have
  </p>
  <p>
   allowed themselves to be tortured to death for proclaiming  that
  </p>
  <p>
   the Resurrection had happened     .
  </p>
  <p>
   "OK, I'm convinced on that one," I said. "But what else do you
  </p>
  <p>
   have?"
  </p>
  <h2>
   EXHIBIT 2: THE CONVERSION OF SKEPTICS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Another piece of circumstantial evidence," Moreland went on, "is
  </p>
  <p>
   that there were hardened skeptics who didn't believe in Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   before his crucifixion-and were to some degree dead-set against
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity-who  turned around and adopted the Christian faith
  </p>
  <p>
   after
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' death. There's no good reason for this apart from them
  </p>
  <p>
   having experienced the resurrected Christ."
  </p>
  <p>
   "You're obviously talking about James, the brother of Jesus, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Saul of Tarsus, who became the apostle Paul," I said. "But do you
  </p>
  <p>
   really have any credible evidence that James had been a skeptic
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus?" "Yes, I do," he said. "The gospels tell us Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   family, including James, were embarrassed by what he was claiming
  </p>
  <p>
   to be. They didn't believe in him; they confronted him. In
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient Judaism it was highly embarrassing for a rabbi's family
  </p>
  <p>
   not to accept him. Therefore the gospel writers would have no
  </p>
  <p>
   motive for fabricating this skepticism if it weren't true.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Later the historian Josephus tells us that James, the brother of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, who was the leader of the Jerusalem church, was stoned to
  </p>
  <p>
   death because of his belief in his brother. Why did James's life
  </p>
  <p>
   change? Paul tells us: the resurrected Jesus appeared to him.
  </p>
  <p>
   There's no other explanation."
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, none jumped to mind. "And Saul?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "As a Pharisee, he hated anything that disrupted the traditions
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Jewish people. To him, this new countermovement called
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity  would have been the height of disloyalty. In fact,
  </p>
  <p>
   he worked out his frustration by executing Christians when he had
  </p>
  <p>
   a chance," Moreland  replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Suddenly he doesn't just ease off Christians but joins their
  </p>
  <p>
   movement! How did this happen? Well, everyone agrees Paul wrote
  </p>
  <p>
   Galatians, and he tells us himself in that letter what caused him
  </p>
  <p>
   to take a 180-degree turn and become the chief proponent of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian faith. By his own pen he says he saw the risen Christ
  </p>
  <p>
   and heard Christ appoint him to be one of his followers."
  </p>
  <p>
   I was waiting for Moreland to make this point, so I could
  </p>
  <p>
   challenge  him with an objection by Christianity critic Michael
  </p>
  <p>
   Martin. He said that if you count Paul's conversion as being
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence for the truth of the Resurrection, you should count
  </p>
  <p>
   Muhammad's conversion to Islam as being evidence for the truth
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus was not resurrected, since Muslims deny the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection!
  </p>
  <p>
   "Basically, he says the evidential values of Paul's conversion
  </p>
  <p>
   and Muhammad's conversion cancel each other out," I told
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreland. "Frankly, that seems like a good point. Won't you admit
  </p>
  <p>
   that he's right?" Moreland didn't bite. "Let's take a look at
  </p>
  <p>
   Muhammad's conversion,"  he said with confidence in his voice.
  </p>
  <p>
   "No one knows anything about it. Muhammad claims he went into a
  </p>
  <p>
   cave and had a religious experience in which Allah revealed the
  </p>
  <p>
   Koran to him. There's no other eyewitness to verify this.
  </p>
  <p>
   Muhammad offered no publicly miraculous signs to certify
  </p>
  <p>
   anything.
  </p>
  <p>
   "And someone easily could have had ulterior motives in following
  </p>
  <p>
   Muhammad, because in the early years Islam was spread largely by
  </p>
  <p>
   warfare. Followers of Muhammad gained political influence and
  </p>
  <p>
   power over the villages that were conquered and 'converted' to
  </p>
  <p>
   Islam by the sword.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Contrast that with the claims of the early followers of Jesus,
  </p>
  <p>
   including Paul. They claimed to have seen public events that
  </p>
  <p>
   other people saw as well. These were things that happened outside
  </p>
  <p>
   their minds, not just in their minds.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Furthermore, when Paul wrote 2 Corinthians -which nobody
  </p>
  <p>
   disputes he did-he reminded the people in Corinth that he
  </p>
  <p>
   performed  miracles when he was with them earlier. He'd certainly
  </p>
  <p>
   be
  </p>
  <p>
   foolish to make this statement if they knew he hadn't."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And your point?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Remember," he said, "it's not the simple fact that Paul changed
  </p>
  <p>
   his views. You have to explain how he had this particular change
  </p>
  <p>
   of belief that completely went against his upbringing; how he saw
  </p>
  <p>
   the risen Christ in a public event that was witnessed by others,
  </p>
  <p>
   even though they didn't understand it; and how he performed
  </p>
  <p>
   miracles to back up his claim to being an apostle."
  </p>
  <p>
   "All right, all right," I said. "I see your point. And I'll
  </p>
  <p>
   admit, it's a good one." With that I gestured for him to go on to
  </p>
  <p>
   his next piece of evidence.

  <p>
   In order to explain his next category of circumstantial proof,
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreland had to provide some important background information
