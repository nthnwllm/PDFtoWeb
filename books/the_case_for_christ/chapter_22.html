  <p>
   to me, 'Well, Greg, it looks like the scholars disagree with
  </p>
  <p>
   you,' and he threw the magazine at me!" Boyd shook his head in
  </p>
  <p>
   both sadness and disbelief. "You see, that article gave him the
  </p>
  <p>
   reason to stop taking me seriously. Even though he knew I was a
  </p>
  <p>
   scholar, he interpreted this article as saying that the majority
  </p>
  <p>
   of scholars-at least, those who aren't wacko fundamentalists-hold
  </p>
  <p>
   these views."
  </p>
  <p>
   I could empathize with Boyd's story, having heard too many
  </p>
  <p>
   people equate the Jesus Seminar with all scholars. "Do you think
  </p>
  <p>
   that impression is an accident?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, the Jesus Seminar certainly portrays itself that way,"
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd replied. "In fact, this is one of its most irritating
  </p>
  <p>
   facets, not just to evangelicals but to other scholars as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you look at their book The Five Gospels, they give 'seven
  </p>
  <p>
   pillars  of scholarly wisdom,' as if you must follow their
  </p>
  <p>
   methodology if you're going to be a true scholar. But a lot of
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars, from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, would have serious
  </p>
  <p>
   reservations about one or even most of these pillars. And the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus Seminar calls its translation  of the Bible 'The Scholars
  </p>
  <p>
   Version'-well, what does that
  </p>
  <p>
   imply? That other versions aren't scholarly?"
  </p>
  <p>
   He paused for a moment, then cut to the core of the issue.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Here's the truth," he said. "The Jesus Seminar represents an
  </p>
  <p>
   extremely small number of radical-fringe scholars who are on the
  </p>
  <p>
   far, far left wing of New Testament thinking. It does not
  </p>
  <p>
   represent mainstream scholarship, and  ironically, they have
  </p>
  <p>
   their own brand of fundamentalism.
  </p>
  <p>
   They say they have the right way of doing things, period." He
  </p>
  <p>
   smiled. "In the name of diversity," he added with a chuckle,
  </p>
  <p>
   "they can actually  be quite narrow."
  </p>
  <h2>
   DISCOVERING THE "REAL" JESUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "At least," I said, "the participants in the Jesus Seminar have
  </p>
  <p>
   been very up-front about their goals, haven't they?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, that's right. They're explicit in saying they want to
  </p>
  <p>
   rescue the Bible from fundamentalism and to free Americans from
  </p>
  <p>
   the 'naive' belief that the Jesus of the Bible is the 'real'
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus. They say they want a Jesus who's relevant for today. One
  </p>
  <p>
   of them said that the traditional  Jesus did not speak to the
  </p>
  <p>
   needs of the ecological crisis, the nuclear crisis, the feminist
  </p>
  <p>
   crisis, so we need a new picture of Jesus. As another one said,
  </p>
  <p>
   we need 'a new fiction.'
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the twists is that they're going directly to the masses
  </p>
  <p>
   instead of to other scholars. They want to take their findings
  </p>
  <p>
   out of the ivory tower and bring them into the marketplace to
  </p>
  <p>
   influence popular  opinion. And what they have in mind is a
  </p>
  <p>
   totally new form of Christianity."
  </p>
  <p>
   The idea of a new Jesus, a new faith, a new Christianity, was
  </p>
  <p>
   intriguing. "So tell me about this Jesus that people from the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus Seminar have discovered," I said. "What's he like?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Basically, they've discovered what they set out to find. Some
  </p>
  <p>
   think he was a political revolutionary, some a religious fanatic,
  </p>
  <p>
   some a wonder worker, some a feminist, some an egalitarian, some
  </p>
  <p>
   a subversive-there's  a lot of diversity," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then he zeroed in on the key issue. "But there is one picture
  </p>
  <p>
   that they all agree with: Jesus first of all must be a
  </p>
  <p>
   naturalistic Jesus. In other words, whatever else is said about
  </p>
  <p>
   him, Jesus was a man like you or me. Maybe he was an
  </p>
  <p>
   extraordinary man, maybe he tapped into our inherent potential as
  </p>
  <p>
   nobody else ever has, but he was not supernatural.
  </p>
  <p>
   So they say Jesus and his early followers didn't see him as God
  </p>
  <p>
   or the Messiah, and they didn't see his death as having any
  </p>
  <p>
   special significance. His crucifixion was unfortunate and
  </p>
  <p>
   untimely, and stories  about his resurrection came later as a way
  </p>
  <p>
   of trying to deal with that sad reality."
  </p>
  <h2>
   GIVING EVIDENCE A FAIR HEARING
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I stood and strolled over to his bookshelf as I formulated my
  </p>
  <p>
   next question. "OK, but you personally have faith that Jesus was
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrected,  and maybe your faith taints your viewpoint too
  </p>
  <p>
   much," I said. "The Jesus Seminar paints itself as being on an
  </p>
  <p>
   unbiased quest for truth, as compared with religiously committed
  </p>
  <p>
   people-people like You-who have a theological agenda."
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd turned in his seat to face me. "Ah, but that's not what's
  </p>
  <p>
   really going on," he insisted. "The participants of the Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   Seminar are at least as biased as evangelicals-and I would say
  </p>
  <p>
   more so. They bring a whole set of assumptions to their
  </p>
  <p>
   scholarship, which of course we all do to some degree.
  </p>
  <p>
   Their major assumption-which, incidentally, is not the product
  </p>
  <p>
   of unbiased scholarly research-is that the gospels are not even
  </p>
  <p>
   generally reliable. They conclude this at the outset because the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels include things that seem historically unlikely, like
  </p>
  <p>
   miracles - walking  on water, raising the dead. These things,
  </p>
  <p>
   they say, just don't happen. That's naturalism, which says that
  </p>
  <p>
   for every effect in the natural  or physical world, there is a
  </p>
  <p>
   natural cause."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yeah, but isn't that the way people typically live their lives?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked. "Are you saying we should be looking for supernatural
  </p>
  <p>
   explanations  behind everything that takes place?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Everyone would agree that you don't appeal to supernatural
  </p>
  <p>
   causes if you don't have to," Boyd said. "But these scholars go
  </p>
  <p>
   beyond that and say you don't ever have to. They operate under
  </p>
  <p>
   the assumption  that everything in history has happened according
  </p>
  <p>
   to their own experiences, and since they've never seen the
  </p>
  <p>
   supernatural, they assume miracles have never occurred in
  </p>
  <p>
   history.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here's what they do: they rule out the possibility of the
  </p>
  <p>
   supernatural  from the beginning, and then they say, 'Now bring
  </p>
  <p>
   on the evidence  about Jesus.' No wonder they get the results
  </p>
  <p>
   they do!"
  </p>
  <p>
   I wanted to turn the tables a bit. "All right, then how would you
  </p>
  <p>
   proceed?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I would grant that you shouldn't appeal to the supernatural
  </p>
  <p>
   until you have to. Yes, first look for a natural explanation. I
  </p>
  <p>
   do that in my own life. A tree falls-OK, maybe there were
  </p>
  <p>
   termites. Now, could an angel have pushed it over? Well, I
  </p>
  <p>
   wouldn't go to that conclusion until there was definite evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   for it.
  </p>
  <p>
   So I grant that. But what I can't grant is the tremendous
  </p>
  <p>
   presumption  that we know enough about the universe to say that
  </p>
  <p>
   God - if  there is a God-can never break into our world in a
  </p>
  <p>
   supernatural way- That's a very presumptuous assumption. That's
  </p>
  <p>
   not a presumption  based on history; now you're doing
  </p>
  <p>
   metaphysics.
  </p>
  <p>
   I think there should be a certain amount of humility in the
  </p>
  <p>
   historical  investigation to say, 'You know what? It is just
  </p>
  <p>
   possible that Jesus Christ did rise from the dead. It's just
  </p>
  <p>
   possible that his disciples  actually saw what the gospels say
  </p>
  <p>
   they saw.' And if there's no other way of accounting adequately
  </p>
  <p>
   for the evidence, let's investigate that possibility.'
  </p>
  <p>
   That, I think, is the only way to give the evidence a fair
  </p>
  <p>
   hearing."
  </p>
  <h2>
   CRITIQUING THE CRITERIA
  </h2>
  <p>
   To come up with their conclusion that Jesus never spoke most of
  </p>
  <p>
   the words in the gospels, members of the Jesus Seminar used their
  </p>
  <p>
   own set of assumptions and criteria. But are these standards
  </p>
  <p>
   reasonable and appropriate? Or were they loaded from the outset,
  </p>
  <p>
   like dice that are weighted so they yield the result that was
  </p>
  <p>
   desired all along? "There are multiple problems with their
  </p>
  <p>
   assumptions and criteria."  Boyd began in analyzing the group's
  </p>
  <p>
   approach. "For instance, they assume that the later church put
  </p>
  <p>
   these sayings into the mouth of Jesus, unless they have good
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence to think otherwise. That assumption is rooted in their
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicion of the gospels, and that comes from their assumption
  </p>
  <p>
   that the supernatural can't occur.
  </p>
  <p>
   Historians usually operate with the burden of proof on the
  </p>
  <p>
   historian  to prove falsity or unreliability, since people are
  </p>
  <p>
   generally not compulsive liars. Without that assumption we'd know
  </p>
  <p>
   very little about ancient history.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Jesus Seminar turns this on its head and says you've got to
  </p>
  <p>
   affirmatively prove that a saying came from Jesus. Then they come
  </p>
  <p>
   up with questionable criteria to do that. Now, it's OK for
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars to use appropriate criteria in considering whether Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   said something. But I'm against the idea that if Jesus doesn't
  </p>
  <p>
   meet these criteria, he must not have said it. That kind of
  </p>
  <p>
   negative conclusion can be a problem." Dealing in this
  </p>
  <p>
   theoretical realm was starting to bring more murkiness  than
  </p>
  <p>
   clarity for me. I needed some concrete examples so I could follow
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd's point. "Talk about some of the specific criteria they
  </p>
  <p>
   used," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "One is called double dissimilarity," he replied. "This means
  </p>
  <p>
   they can believe Jesus said something if it doesn't look like
  </p>
  <p>
   something  a rabbi or the later church would say. Otherwise they
  </p>
  <p>
   assume it got into the gospels from a Jewish or Christian source.
  </p>
  <p>
   The obvious problem is that Jesus was Jewish and he founded the
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian church, so it shouldn't be surprising if he sounds
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish  and Christian! Yet they've applied this criterion to
  </p>
  <p>
   reach the negative  conclusion that Jesus didn't say a whole lot.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then there's the criterion of 'multiple attestation,' which means
  </p>
  <p>
   we can only be sure Jesus said something if it's found in more
  </p>
  <p>
   than one source. Now, this can be a helpful test in confirming a
  </p>
  <p>
   saying. However,  why argue in the other direction-if it's only
  </p>
  <p>
   found in one source, it's not valid? In fact, most of ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   history is based on single sources.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Generally, if a source is considered reliable-and I would argue
  </p>
  <p>
   that there are plenty of reasons to believe that the gospels are
  </p>
  <p>
   reliable-it should be considered credible, even if it can't be
  </p>
  <p>
   confirmed by other sources.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even when Jesus' sayings are found in two or three gospels, they
  </p>
  <p>
   don't consider this as passing the 'multiple attestation'
  </p>
  <p>
   criterion. If a saying is found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, they
  </p>
  <p>
   consider that only one source, because they assume that Matthew
  </p>
  <p>
   and Luke used Mark in writing their gospels. They're failing to
  </p>
  <p>
   recognize that an increasing  number of scholars are expressing
  </p>
  <p>
   serious reservations about the theory that Matthew and Luke used
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark. With this line of thinking, you can see why it's extremely
  </p>
  <p>
   difficult to prove multiple attestation." Boyd started to go on,
  </p>
  <p>
   but I told him he had already made his point: loaded criteria,
  </p>
  <p>
   like weighted dice, inevitably bring the results that were
  </p>
  <p>
   desired from the beginning.

  <h2>
   JESUS THE WONDER WORKER
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   One approach taken by naturalistic scholars has been to look for
  </p>
  <p>
   parallels  between Jesus and others from ancient history as a way
  </p>
  <p>
   of
  </p>
  <p>
   demonstrating that his claims and deeds were not completely
  </p>
  <p>
   unique. Their goal is to explain away the view that Jesus was one
  </p>
  <p>
   of a kind. "How do you respond to this?" I asked Boyd. "For
  </p>
  <p>
   example, there were ancient rabbis who did exorcisms or prayed
  </p>
  <p>
   for rain and it came, so some scholars have said Jesus was merely
  </p>
  <p>
   another example of a Jewish wonder worker. Do those parallels
  </p>
  <p>
   hold up?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I was about to see Boyd the debater in action as he responded
  </p>
  <p>
   point by point to a complex issue without the benefit of notes. I
  </p>
  <p>
   was glad I was taping our conversation; my note taking would
  </p>
  <p>
   never have kept up with his rapid-fire delivery.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Actually, the parallels break down quickly when you look more
  </p>
  <p>
   closely," he began, picking up speed as he went. "For one thing,
  </p>
  <p>
   the sheer centrality of the supernatural in the life of Jesus has
  </p>
  <p>
   no parallel  whatsoever in Jewish history.
  </p>
  <p>
   Second, the radical nature of his miracles distinguishes him. It
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't just rain when he prayed for it; we're talking about
  </p>
  <p>
   blindness, deafness, leprosy, and scoliosis being healed, storms
