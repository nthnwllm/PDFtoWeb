  <p>
   Jesus, and not breaking his legs. And the prophecies talk about
  </p>
  <p>
   betrayal for thirty pieces of silver, so maybe Matthew played
  </p>
  <p>
   fast and loose with the facts and said, yeah, Judas sold out
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus for that same amount." But that objection didn't fly any
  </p>
  <p>
   further than the previous one. "In God's wisdom, he created
  </p>
  <p>
   checks and balances both inside and outside the Christian
  </p>
  <p>
   community," Lapides explained. "When the gospels were being
  </p>
  <p>
   circulated, there were people living who had been around when all
  </p>
  <p>
   these things happened. Someone would have said to Matthew, 'You
  </p>
  <p>
   know it didn't happen that way. We're trying to communicate  a
  </p>
  <p>
   life of righteousness and truth, so don't taint it with a lie.'
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides," he added, "why would Matthew have fabricated fulfilled
  </p>
  <p>
   prophecies and then willingly allowed himself to be put to death
  </p>
  <p>
   for following someone who he secretly knew was really not the
  </p>
  <p>
   Messiah? That wouldn't make any sense.
  </p>
  <p>
   What's more, the Jewish community would have jumped on any
  </p>
  <p>
   opportunity to discredit the gospels by pointing out falsehoods.
  </p>
  <p>
   They would have said, 'I was there, and Jesus' bones were broken
  </p>
  <p>
   by the Romans during the Crucifixion,'" Lapides said. "But even
  </p>
  <p>
   though the Jewish Talmud refers to Jesus in derogatory ways, it
  </p>
  <p>
   never once makes the claim that the fulfillment of prophecies was
  </p>
  <p>
   falsified. Not one time." 3. The Intentional Fulfillment Argument
  </p>
  <p>
   Some skeptics have asserted that Jesus merely maneuvered his life
  </p>
  <p>
   in a way to fulfill the prophecies. "Couldn't he have read in
  </p>
  <p>
   Zechariah that the Messiah would ride a donkey into Jerusalem,
  </p>
  <p>
   and then arrange to do exactly that?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lapides made a small concession. "For a few of the prophecies,
  </p>
  <p>
   yes, that's certainly conceivable," he said. "But there are many
  </p>
  <p>
   others  for which this just wouldn't have been possible.
  </p>
  <p>
   "For instance, how would he control the fact that the Sanhedrin
  </p>
  <p>
   offered Judas thirty pieces of silver to betray him? How could he
  </p>
  <p>
   arrange for his ancestry, or the place of his birth, or his
  </p>
  <p>
   method of execution, or that soldiers gambled for his clothing,
  </p>
  <p>
   or that his legs remained unbroken on the cross? How would he
  </p>
  <p>
   arrange to perform miracles in front of skeptics? How would he
  </p>
  <p>
   arrange for his resurrection?  And how would he arrange to be
  </p>
  <p>
   born when he was?"
  </p>
  <p>
   That last comment piqued my curiosity. "What do you mean by when
  </p>
  <p>
   he was born?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "When you interpret Daniel 9:24-26, it foretells that the Messiah
  </p>
  <p>
   would appear a certain length of time after King Artaxerxes 1
  </p>
  <p>
   issued a decree for the Jewish people to go from Persia to
  </p>
  <p>
   rebuild the walls in Jerusalem," Lapides replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   He leaned forward to deliver the clincher: "That puts the
  </p>
  <p>
   anticipated  appearance of the Messiah at the exact moment in
  </p>
  <p>
   history when Jesus showed up," he said. "Certainly that's nothing
  </p>
  <p>
   he could have prearranged  ."
  </p>
  <p>
   4. The Context Argument
  </p>
  <p>
   One other objection needed to be addressed: were the passages
  </p>
  <p>
   that Christians identify as messianic prophecies really intended
  </p>
  <p>
   to point to the coming of the Anointed One, or do Christians rip
  </p>
  <p>
   them out of context and misinterpret them?
  </p>
  <p>
   Lapides sighed. "You know, I go through the books that people
  </p>
  <p>
   write to try to tear down what we believe. That's not fun to do,
  </p>
  <p>
   but I spend the time to look at each objection individually and
  </p>
  <p>
   then to research the context and the wording in the original
  </p>
  <p>
   language," he said. "And every single time, the prophecies have
  </p>
  <p>
   stood up and shown themselves to be true.
  </p>
  <p>
   "So here's my challenge to skeptics: don't accept my word for it,
  </p>
  <p>
   but don't accept your rabbi's either. Spend the time to research
  </p>
  <p>
   it yourself. Today nobody can say, 'There's no information.'
  </p>
  <p>
   There are plenty of books out there to help you.
  </p>
  <p>
   "And one more thing: sincerely ask God to show you whether or not
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus is the Messiah. That's what I did-and without any coaching
  </p>
  <p>
   it became clear to me who fit the fingerprint of the Messiah."
  </p>
  <h2>
   "EVERYTHING MUST BE FULFILLED..."
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I appreciated the way Lapides had responded to the objections,
  </p>
  <p>
   but ultimately it was the story of his spiritual journey that
  </p>
  <p>
   kept replaying in my mind as I flew back to Chicago late that
  </p>
  <p>
   night. I reflected on how many times I had encountered similar
  </p>
  <p>
   stories, especially among successful and thoughtful Jewish people
  </p>
  <p>
   who had specifically set out to refute Jesus' messianic claims.
  </p>
  <p>
   I thought about Stan Telchin, the East Coast businessman who had
  </p>
  <p>
   embarked on a quest to expose the "cult" of Christianity after
  </p>
  <p>
   his daughter went away to college and received Y'Shua (Jesus) as
  </p>
  <p>
   her Messiah. He was astonished to find that his investigation led
  </p>
  <p>
   himand  his wife and second daughter-to the same Messiah. He
  </p>
  <p>
   later became a Christian minister, and his book that recounts his
  </p>
  <p>
   story, Betrayed!, has been translated into more than twenty
  </p>
  <p>
   languages. There was Jack Sternberg, a prominent cancer
  </p>
  <p>
   physician in Little
  </p>
  <p>
   Rock, Arkansas, who was
  </p>
  <p>
   so alarmed at what he found in the Old Testament that he
  </p>
  <p>
   challenged three rabbis to disprove that Jesus was the Messiah.
  </p>
  <p>
   They couldn't, and he too has claimed to have found wholeness in
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
   And there was Peter Greenspan, an obstetrician-gynecologist who
  </p>
  <p>
   practices in the Kansas City area and is a clinical assistant
  </p>
  <p>
   professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of
  </p>
  <p>
   Medicine. Like Lapides, he had been challenged to look for Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   in Judaism. What he found troubled him, so he went to the Torah
  </p>
  <p>
   and Talmud, seeking to discredit Jesus' messianic credentials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead he concluded that Jesus did miraculously fulfill the
  </p>
  <p>
   prophecies.
  </p>
  <p>
   For him, the more he read books by those trying to undermine the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence for Jesus as the Messiah, the more he saw the flaws in
  </p>
  <p>
   their arguments. Ironically, concluded Greenspan, "I think I
  </p>
  <p>
   actually came to faith in Yhua by reading what detractors wrote."
  </p>
  <p>
   He found, as have Lapides and others, that Jesus' words in the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel of Luke have proved true: "Everything must be fulfilled
  </p>
  <p>
   that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and
  </p>
  <p>
   the Psalms" (Luke 24:44). It was fulfilled, and only in Jesus-the
  </p>
  <p>
   sole individual in history who has matched the prophetic
  </p>
  <p>
   fingerprint of God's anointed one.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <p>
   Questions forReflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.   Even if you're not Jewish, is there an aspect of Lapides'
  </p>
  <p>
   spiritual journey that is similar to your own? Were there any
  </p>
  <p>
   lessons you learned from Lapides about how you should proceed?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.   Lapides considered his Jewish heritage and unbiblical
  </p>
  <p>
   lifestyle impediments to becoming a follower of Jesus. Is there
  </p>
  <p>
   anything in your life that would make it difficult to become a
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian? Do you see any costs that you might incur if you
  </p>
  <p>
   became a Christian? How might they compare with the benefits?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.   Lapides thought Christians were anti-Semitic. In a recent
  </p>
  <p>
   wordassociation  exercise at an East Coast university, the word
  </p>
  <p>
   most
  </p>
  <p>
   often associated with Christian was intolerant. Do you have
  </p>
  <p>
   negative  perceptions of Christians? What do they stem from? How
  </p>
  <p>
   might this influence your receptivity to the evidence about
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus?

   Researching the Resurrection

   11: THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE
  </p>
  <p>
   Was jesus' Death a Scam and His Resurrection a Hoax?
  </p>
  <p>
   I paused to read the plaque hanging in the waiting room of a
  </p>
  <p>
   doctor's office: "Let conversation cease. Let laughter flee. This
  </p>
  <p>
   is the place where death delights to help the living."
  </p>
  <p>
   Obviously, this was no ordinary physician. I was paying another
  </p>
  <p>
   visit to Dr. Robert J. Stein, one of the world's foremost
  </p>
  <p>
   forensic pathologists,  a flamboyant, husky-voiced medical
  </p>
  <p>
   detective who used to
  </p>
  <p>
   regale me with stories about the unexpected clues he had
  </p>
  <p>
   uncovered while examining corpses. For him, dead men did tell
  </p>
  <p>
   tales-in fact, tales that would often bring justice to the
  </p>
  <p>
   living.
  </p>
  <p>
   During his lengthy tenure as medical examiner of Cook County,
  </p>
  <p>
   Illinois, Stein performed more than twenty thousand autopsies,
  </p>
  <p>
   each time meticulously searching for insights into the
  </p>
  <p>
   circumstances surrounding  the victim's death. Repeatedly his
  </p>
  <p>
   sharp eye for detail, his encyclopedic knowledge of the human
  </p>
  <p>
   anatomy, and his uncanny investigative intuition helped this
  </p>
  <p>
   medical sleuth reconstruct the victim's  violent demise.

   Sometimes innocent people were vindicated as a result of his
  </p>
  <p>
   findings. But more often Stein's work was the final nail in a
  </p>
  <p>
   defendant's  coffin. Such was the case with John Wayne Gacy, who
  </p>
  <p>
   faced
  </p>
  <p>
   the executioner after Stein helped convict him of thirty-three
  </p>
  <p>
   grisly murders.
  </p>
  <p>
   That's how crucial medical evidence can be. It can determine
  </p>
  <p>
   whether a child died of abuse or an accidental fall. It can
  </p>
  <p>
   establish whether a person succumbed to natural causes or was
  </p>
  <p>
   murdered by someone who spiked the person's coffee with arsenic.
  </p>
  <p>
   It can uphold or dismantle a defendant's alibi by pinpointing the
  </p>
  <p>
   victim's time of death, using an ingenious procedure that
  </p>
  <p>
   measures the amount of potassium in the eyes of the deceased.
  </p>
  <p>
   And yes, even in the case of someone brutally executed on a Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   cross two millennia ago, medical evidence can still make a
  </p>
  <p>
   crucial contribution: it can destroy one of the most persistent
  </p>
  <p>
   arguments  used by those who claim that the resurrection of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus-the supreme vindication of his claim to deity-was nothing
  </p>
  <p>
   more than an elaborate hoax.

  <h2>
   RESURRECTION OR RESUSCITATION?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The idea that Jesus never really died on the cross can be found
  </p>
  <p>
   in the Koran, which was written in the seventh century-in fact,
  </p>
  <p>
   Ahmadiya Muslims contend that Jesus actually fled to India. To
  </p>
  <p>
   this day there's a shrine that supposedly marks his real burial
  </p>
  <p>
   place in Srinagar, Kashmir!
  </p>
  <p>
   As the nineteenth century dawned, Karl Bahrdt, Karl Venturini,
  </p>
  <p>
   and others tried to explain away the Resurrection by suggesting
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus only fainted from exhaustion on the cross, or he had
  </p>
  <p>
   been given a drug that made him appear to die, and that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   later been revived by the cool, damp air of the tomb.
  </p>
  <p>
   Conspiracy theorists bolstered this hypothesis by pointing out
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus had been given some liquid on a sponge while on the
  </p>
  <p>
   cross (Mark 15:36) and that Pilate seemed surprised at how
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly Jesus had succumbed (Mark 15:44). Consequently, they
  </p>
  <p>
   said, Jesus' reappearance  wasn't a miraculous resurrection but
  </p>
  <p>
   merely a fortuitous
  </p>
  <p>
   resuscitation, and his tomb was empty because he continued to
  </p>
  <p>
   live, While reputable scholars have repudiated this so-called
  </p>
  <p>
   swoon theory,  it keeps recurring in popular literature. In 1929
  </p>
  <p>
   D. H. Lawrence wove this theme into a short story in which he
  </p>
  <p>
   suggested that Jesus had fled to Egypt, where he fell in love
  </p>
  <p>
   with the priestess Isis. In 1965 Hugh Schonfield's best-seller
  </p>
  <p>
   The Passover Plot alleged that it was only the unanticipated
