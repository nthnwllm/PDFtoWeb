  <h2>
   WAS JESUS REALLY BURIED IN THE TOMB?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Before looking at whether the tomb of Jesus was empty, I needed
  </p>
  <p>
   to establish whether his body had been there in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>
   History tells us that as a rule, crucified criminals were left on
  </p>
  <p>
   the cross to be devoured by birds or were thrown into a common
  </p>
  <p>
   grave. This has prompted John Dominic Crossan of the Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   Seminar to conclude that Jesus' body probably was dug up and
  </p>
  <p>
   consumed by wild dogs. "Based on these customary practices," I
  </p>
  <p>
   said to Craig, "wouldn't you admit that this is most likely what
  </p>
  <p>
   happened?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "If all you looked at was customary practice, yes, I'd agree,"
  </p>
  <p>
   came his reply. "But that would ignore the specific evidence in
  </p>
  <p>
   this case." "OK, then let's look at the specific evidence," I
  </p>
  <p>
   said. With that I pointed out an immediate problem: the gospels
  </p>
  <p>
   say Jesus' corpse was turned over to Joseph of Arimathea, a
  </p>
  <p>
   member of the very councilthe  Sanhedrin-that voted to condemn
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus. "That's rather implausible,  isn't it?" I demanded in a
  </p>
  <p>
   tone that sounded more pointed than I had intended.
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig shifted on the couch as if he were getting ready to pounce
  </p>
  <p>
   on my question. "No, not when you look at all the evidence for
  </p>
  <p>
   the burial," he said. "So let me go through it. For one thing,
  </p>
  <p>
   the burial is mentioned by the apostle Paul in I Corinthians
  </p>
  <p>
   15:3-7, where he passes on a very early creed of the church."
  </p>
  <p>
   I acknowledged this with a nod, since Dr. Craig Blomberg had
  </p>
  <p>
   already described this creed in some detail during our earlier
  </p>
  <p>
   interview.  Craig agreed with Blomberg that the creed undoubtedly
  </p>
  <p>
   goes back to within a few years of Jesus' crucifixion, having
  </p>
  <p>
   been given to Paul, after his conversion, in Damascus or in his
  </p>
  <p>
   subsequent visit to Jerusalem when he met with the apostles James
  </p>
  <p>
   and Peter.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since Craig was going to be referring to the creed, I opened the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible in my lap and quickly reviewed the passage: "For what I
  </p>
  <p>
   received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ
  </p>
  <p>
   died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Scriptures . . ." The creed then goes on to list several
  </p>
  <p>
   appearances of the resurrected Jesus. "This creed is incredibly
  </p>
  <p>
   early and therefore trustworthy material,"  Craig said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Essentially, it's a four-line formula. The first line refers to
  </p>
  <p>
   the Crucifixion, the second to the burial, the third to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection,  and the fourth to Jesus' appearances. As you can
  </p>
  <p>
   see, the
  </p>
  <p>
   second line affirms that Jesus was buried."
  </p>
  <p>
   That was too vague for me. "Wait a minute," I interjected. "He
  </p>
  <p>
   may have been buried, but was it in a tomb? And was it through
  </p>
  <p>
   Joseph of Arimathea, this mysterious character who comes out of
  </p>
  <p>
   nowhere to claim the body?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig remained patient. "This creed is actually a summary that
  </p>
  <p>
   corresponds line by line with what the gospels teach," he
  </p>
  <p>
   explained. "When we turn to the gospels, we find multiple,
  </p>
  <p>
   independent attestation  of this burial story, and Joseph of
  </p>
  <p>
   Arimathea is specifically named in all four accounts. On top of
  </p>
  <p>
   that, the burial story in Mark is so extremely early that it's
  </p>
  <p>
   simply not possible for it to have been subject  to legendary
  </p>
  <p>
   corruption."
  </p>
  <p>
   "How can you tell it's early?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Two reasons," he said. "First, Mark is generally considered to
  </p>
  <p>
   be the earliest gospel. Second, his gospel basically consists of
  </p>
  <p>
   short anecdotes about Jesus, more like pearls on a string than a
  </p>
  <p>
   smooth, continuous narrative.
  </p>
  <p>
   "But when you get to the last week of Jesus' life-the so-called
  </p>
  <p>
   passion story-then you do have a continuous narrative of events
  </p>
  <p>
   in sequence. This passion story was apparently taken by Mark from
  </p>
  <p>
   an even earlier source-and this source included the story of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus being buried in the tomb."
  </p>
  <h2>
   IS JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA HISTORICAL?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While those were good arguments, I spotted a problem with Mark's
  </p>
  <p>
   account of what happened. "Mark says that the entire Sanhedrin
  </p>
  <p>
   voted to condemn Jesus," I said. "If that's true, this means
  </p>
  <p>
   Joseph of Arimathea cast his ballot to kill Jesus. Isn't it
  </p>
  <p>
   highly unlikely that he would have then come to give Jesus an
  </p>
  <p>
   honorable burial?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Apparently, my observation put me in good company. "Luke may have
  </p>
  <p>
   felt this same discomfort," Craig said, "which would explain why
  </p>
  <p>
   he added one important detail-Joseph of Arimathea wasn't present
  </p>
  <p>
   when the official vote was taken. So that would explain things.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the significant point about Joseph of Arimathea is that he
  </p>
  <p>
   would not be the sort of person who would have been invented by
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian legend or Christian authors."
  </p>
  <p>
   I needed more than merely a conclusion on that matter; I wanted
  </p>
  <p>
   some solid reasoning. "Why not?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Given the early Christian anger and bitterness toward the Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   leaders who had instigated the crucifixion of Jesus," he said,
  </p>
  <p>
   "it's highly improbable that they would have invented one who did
  </p>
  <p>
   the right thing by giving Jesus an honorable burial -especially
  </p>
  <p>
   while all of Jesus' disciples deserted him! Besides, they
  </p>
  <p>
   wouldn't make up a specific member of a specific group, whom
  </p>
  <p>
   people could check out for themselves and ask about this. So
  </p>
  <p>
   Joseph is undoubtedly a historical figure."
  </p>
  <p>
   Before I could ask a follow-up question, Craig continued. "I'll
  </p>
  <p>
   add that if this burial by Joseph were a legend that developed
  </p>
  <p>
   later, you'd expect to find other competing burial traditions
  </p>
  <p>
   about what happened  to Jesus' body. However, you don't find
  </p>
  <p>
   these at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a result, the majority of New Testament scholars today agree
  </p>
  <p>
   that the burial account of Jesus is fundamentally reliable. John
  </p>
  <p>
   A. T. Robinson, the late Cambridge University New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   scholar, said the honorable burial of Jesus is one of the
  </p>
  <p>
   earliest and best-attested facts that we have about the
  </p>
  <p>
   historical Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig's explanations satisfied me that Jesus' body was indeed
  </p>
  <p>
   placed in Joseph's tomb. But the creed left an ambiguity:
  </p>
  <p>
   perhaps, even after the Resurrection, his body remained entombed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "While the creed says Jesus was crucified, buried, and then
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrected,  it doesn't specifically say the tomb was empty," I
  </p>
  <p>
   pointed out. "Doesn't this leave room for the possibility that
  </p>
  <p>
   the Resurrection was only spiritual in nature and that Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   body was still in the tomb?" "The creed definitely implies the
  </p>
  <p>
   empty tomb," Craig countered. "You see, the Jews had a physical
  </p>
  <p>
   concept of resurrection. For them, the primary object of the
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection was the bones of the deceased-not even the flesh,
  </p>
  <p>
   which was thought to be perishable. After the flesh rotted away,
  </p>
  <p>
   the Jews would gather the bones of their deceased and put them in
  </p>
  <p>
   boxes to be preserved until the resurrection  at the end of the
  </p>
  <p>
   world, when God would raise the righteous dead of Israel and they
  </p>
  <p>
   would come together in the final kingdom of God. In light of
  </p>
  <p>
   this, it would have been simply a contradiction of terms for an
  </p>
  <p>
   early Jew to say that someone was raised from the dead but his
  </p>
  <p>
   body still was left in the tomb. So when this early Christian
  </p>
  <p>
   creed says Jesus was buried and then raised on the third day,
  </p>
  <p>
   it's saying  implicitly but quite clearly: an empty tomb was left
  </p>
  <p>
   behind."
  </p>
  <h2>
   HOW SECURE WAS THE TOMB?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Having heard convincing evidence that Jesus had been in the tomb,
  </p>
  <p>
   it seemed important to know how secure his grave was from
  </p>
  <p>
   outtside influences. The tighter the security, the less likely
  </p>
  <p>
   the body could have been tampered with. "How protected was Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb?" I asked. Craig proceeded to describe how this kind of tomb
  </p>
  <p>
   looked, as best as archaeologists have been able to determine
  </p>
  <p>
   from excavations of first-century sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   "There was a slanted groove that led down to a low entrance, and
  </p>
  <p>
   a large disk-shaped stone was rolled down this groove and lodged
  </p>
  <p>
   into place across the door," he said, using his hands to
  </p>
  <p>
   illustrate what he was saying. "A smaller stone was then used to
  </p>
  <p>
   secure the disk. Although it would be easy to roll this big disk
  </p>
  <p>
   down the groove, it would take several men to roll the stone back
  </p>
  <p>
   up in order to reopen the tomb. In that sense it was quite
  </p>
  <p>
   secure."
  </p>
  <p>
   However, was Jesus' tomb also guarded? I knew that some skeptics
  </p>
  <p>
   have attempted to cast doubt on the popular belief that Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb was carefully watched around the clock by highly disciplined
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman soldiers, who faced death themselves if they failed in
  </p>
  <p>
   their duty. "Are you convinced there were Roman guards?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Only Matthew reports that guards were placed around the
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb," he replied. "But in any event, I don't think the guard
  </p>
  <p>
   story is an important facet of the evidence for the Resurrection.
  </p>
  <p>
   For one thing, it's too disputed by contemporary scholarship. I
  </p>
  <p>
   find it's prudent to base my arguments on evidence that's most
  </p>
  <p>
   widely accepted by the majority of scholars, so the guard story
  </p>
  <p>
   is better left aside." I was surprised by his approach. "Doesn't
  </p>
  <p>
   that weaken your
  </p>
  <p>
   case?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig shook his head. "Frankly, the guard story may have been
  </p>
  <p>
   important in the eighteenth century, when critics were suggesting
  </p>
  <p>
   that the disciples stole Jesus' body, but nobody espouses that
  </p>
  <p>
   theory today," he responded.
  </p>
  <p>
   "When you read the New Testament," he continued, "there's no
  </p>
  <p>
   doubt that the disciples sincerely believed the truth of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection,  which they proclaimed to their deaths. The idea
  </p>
  <p>
   that the empty tomb is the result of some hoax, conspiracy, or
  </p>
  <p>
   theft is simply dismissed  today. So the guard story has become
  </p>
  <p>
   sort of incidental."
  </p>
  <h2>
   WERE ANY GUARDS PRESENT?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Even so, I was interested in whether there was any evidence to
  </p>
  <p>
   back up Matthew's assertion about the guards. Although I
  </p>
  <p>
   understood Craig's reasons for setting aside the issue, I pressed
  </p>
  <p>
   ahead by asking whether there was any good evidence that the
  </p>
  <p>
   guard story is historical. "Yes, there is," he said. "Think about
  </p>
  <p>
   the claims and counterclaims  about the Resurrection that went
  </p>
  <p>
   back and forth between the Jews and Christians in the first
  </p>
  <p>
   century.
  </p>
  <p>
   The initial Christian proclamation was, 'Jesus is risen.' The
  </p>
  <p>
   Jews responded, 'The disciples stole his body.' To this
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians said, 'Ah, but the guards at the tomb would have
  </p>
  <p>
   prevented such a theft.' The Jews responded, 'Oh, but the guards
  </p>
  <p>
   at the tomb fell asleep.' To that the Christians  replied,
  </p>
  <p>
   'No, the Jews bribed the guards to say they fell asleep.'
  </p>
  <p>
   "Now, if there had not been any guards, the exchange would have
  </p>
  <p>
   gone like this: In response to the claim Jesus is risen, the Jews
  </p>
  <p>
   would say, 'No, the disciples stole his body.' Christians would
  </p>
  <p>
   reply, 'But the guards would have prevented the theft.' Then the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish response would have been, 'What guards? You're crazy!
  </p>
  <p>
   There were no guards!' Yet history tells us that's not what the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jews said.
  </p>
  <p>
   This suggests the guards really were historical and that the Jews
  </p>
  <p>
   knew it, which is why they had to invent the absurd story about
  </p>
  <p>
   the guards having been asleep while the disciples took the body."
  </p>
  <p>
   Again a nagging question prompted me to jump in. "There seems to
  </p>
  <p>
   be another problem here," I said, pausing as I tried to formulate
  </p>
  <p>
   my objection as succinctly as I could.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Why would the Jewish authorities have placed guards at the tomb
  </p>
  <p>
   in the first place? If they were anticipating a resurrection or
