  <h2>
   2: TESTING THE EYEWITNESS EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Do the Biographies of Jesus Stand Up to Scrutiny?
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Sixteen-year-old Michael McCullough's words were so faint that
  </p>
  <p>
   jurors couldn't hear them above the soft puffing sound of the
  </p>
  <p>
   mechanical respirator that was keeping him alive. A lip-reader
  </p>
  <p>
   had to hunch over Michael's bed, discern what he was saying, and
  </p>
  <p>
   repeat his testimony to the makeshift courtroom.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paralyzed from the neck down by a bullet that severed his spinal
  </p>
  <p>
   cord, Michael was too frail to be transported to the courthouse
  </p>
  <p>
   for the trial of the two youths accused of attacking him. Instead
  </p>
  <p>
   the judge, jury, defendants, lawyers, reporters, and spectators
  </p>
  <p>
   crowded into Michael's hospital room, which was declared a
  </p>
  <p>
   temporary branch of Cook County Circuit Court.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under questioning by prosecutors, Michael recalled how he left
  </p>
  <p>
   his apartment at a Chicago housing project with two dollars in
  </p>
  <p>
   his pocket. He said he was accosted in a stairway by the two
  </p>
  <p>
   defendants, who intentionally shot him in the face as they tried
  </p>
  <p>
   to steal his money. His story was backed up by two other youths
  </p>
  <p>
   who had watched in horror  as the assault took place.
  </p>
  <p>
   The defendants never denied the shooting; instead they claimed
  </p>
  <p>
   that the gun accidentally discharged while they were waving it
  </p>
  <p>
   around. Defense attorneys knew that the only way they could get
  </p>
  <p>
   their clients off with a reduced sentence was if they could
  </p>
  <p>
   succeed in undermining the testimony that the shooting was a
  </p>
  <p>
   vicious and premeditated  act of violence.
  </p>
  <p>
   They did their best to cast doubt on the eyewitness accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
   They questioned the witnesses' ability to view what happened, but
  </p>
  <p>
   they failed to make any inroads. They tried to exploit
  </p>
  <p>
   inconsistencies in the stories, but the accounts harmonized on
  </p>
  <p>
   the central points. They demanded more corroboration, but clearly
  </p>
  <p>
   no more was needed. They raised hints about character, but the
  </p>
  <p>
   victim and witnesses were law-abiding youths with no criminal
  </p>
  <p>
   record. They hoped to show a bias against the defendants, but
  </p>
  <p>
   they couldn't find one. They questioned  whether one witness, a
  </p>
  <p>
   nine-year-old boy named Keith, was
  </p>
  <p>
   old enough to understand what it meant to tell the truth under
  </p>
  <p>
   oath, but it was obvious to everyone that he did.
  </p>
  <p>
   With defense attorneys unable to shake the credibility of the
  </p>
  <p>
   victim  and the prosecution witnesses, the two defendants were
  </p>
  <p>
   convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to fifty years in the
  </p>
  <p>
   penitentiary. Eighteen days later Michael died.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Defense attorneys have a challenging job: to raise questions, to
  </p>
  <p>
   generate doubts, to probe the soft and vulnerable spots of a
  </p>
  <p>
   witness's story. They do this by subjecting the testimony to a
  </p>
  <p>
   variety of tests. The idea is that honest and accurate testimony
  </p>
  <p>
   will withstand scrutiny, while false, exaggerated, or misleading
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony will be exposed. In Michael's case justice prevailed
  </p>
  <p>
   because the jurors could tell that the witnesses and victim were
  </p>
  <p>
   sincerely and precisely recounting  what they had experienced.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now let's return to our investigation of the historical evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning Jesus. The time had come to subject Dr. Blomberg's
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony  to tests that would either reveal its weaknesses or
  </p>
  <p>
   underscore its strength. Many of these would be the same tests
  </p>
  <p>
   that had been used by defense attorneys in Michael's case so many
  </p>
  <p>
   years earlier. "There are eight different tests I'd like to ask
  </p>
  <p>
   you about," I said to Blomberg as we sat down after our fifteen-
  </p>
  <p>
   minute break.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg picked up a fresh cup of steaming black coffee and
  </p>
  <p>
   leaned back. I wasn't sure, but it seemed he was looking forward
  </p>
  <p>
   to the challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Go ahead," he said.
  </p>
  <h2>
   I. THE INTENTION TEST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   This test seeks to determine whether it was the stated or implied
  </p>
  <p>
   intention of the writers to accurately preserve history. "Were
  </p>
  <p>
   these first-century writers even interested in recording what
  </p>
  <p>
   actually happened?"  I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg nodded. "Yes, they were," he said. "You can
  </p>
  <p>
   see that at the beginning of the gospel of Luke, which reads very
  </p>
  <p>
   much like prefaces to other generally trusted historical and
  </p>
  <p>
   biographical works of antiquity."
  </p>
  <p>
   Picking up his Bible, Blomberg read the opening of Luke's gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that
  </p>
  <p>
   have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us
  </p>
  <p>
   by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants  of
  </p>
  <p>
   the word. Therefore, since I myself have carefully
  </p>
  <p>
   investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good
  </p>
  <p>
   also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent
  </p>
  <p>
   Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you
  </p>
  <p>
   have been taught.
  </p>
  <p>
   "As you can see," Blomberg continued, "Luke is clearly saying he
  </p>
  <p>
   intended to write accurately about the things he investigated and
  </p>
  <p>
   found to be well-supported by witnesses."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What about the other gospels?" I asked. "They don't start with
  </p>
  <p>
   similar declarations; does that mean their writers didn't have
  </p>
  <p>
   the same intentions?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "It's true that Mark and Matthew don't have this kind of explicit
  </p>
  <p>
   statement," came Blomberg's reply. "However, they are close to
  </p>
  <p>
   Luke in terms of genre, and it seems reasonable that Luke's
  </p>
  <p>
   historical intent would closely mirror theirs."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And John?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The only other statement of purpose in the gospels comes in John
  </p>
  <p>
   20:31: 'These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life
  </p>
  <p>
   in his name.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   "That," I objected, "sounds more like a theological statement
  </p>
  <p>
   than a historical one."
  </p>
  <p>
   "I'll grant you that," Blomberg replied. "But if you're going to
  </p>
  <p>
   be convinced enough to believe, the theology has to flow from
  </p>
  <p>
   accurate history.  Besides, there's an important piece of
  </p>
  <p>
   implicit evidence that can't be overlooked. Consider the way the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels are written-in a sober and responsible fashion, with
  </p>
  <p>
   accurate incidental details, with obvious care and exactitude.
  </p>
  <p>
   You don't find the outlandish flourishes and blatant
  </p>
  <p>
   mythologizing that you see in a lot of other ancient writings.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What does all that add up to?" he asked. Then he answered his
  </p>
  <p>
   own question: "It seems quite apparent that the goal of the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel writers was to attempt to record what had actually
  </p>
  <p>
   occurred."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Answering Objections
  </p>
  <p>
   However, is that what really happened? There's a competing and
  </p>
  <p>
   contradictory scenario that has been promoted by some critics.
  </p>
  <p>
   They have said that early Christians were convinced Jesus was
  </p>
  <p>
   going to be returning during their lifetime to consummate
  </p>
  <p>
   history, so they didn't think it was necessary to preserve any
  </p>
  <p>
   historical records about his life or teachings. After all, why
  </p>
  <p>
   bother if he's going to come and end the world at any moment?
  </p>
  <p>
   "so, " I said, "years later when it became obvious that Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   wasn't coming back right away, they found they didn't have any
  </p>
  <p>
   accurate historical  material to draw on in writing the gospels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nothing had been captured for historical purposes. Isn't that
  </p>
  <p>
   what really happened?" "There are certainly sects and groups,
  </p>
  <p>
   including religious ones throughout history, for which that
  </p>
  <p>
   argument works, but not with early Christianity," Blomberg
  </p>
  <p>
   replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Why not?" I challenged him. "What was so different about
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "First, I think the premise is a bit overstated. The truth is
  </p>
  <p>
   that the majority of Jesus' teachings presuppose a significant
  </p>
  <p>
   span of time before the end of the world," he said. "But second,
  </p>
  <p>
   even if some of Jesus' followers did think he might come back
  </p>
  <p>
   fairly quickly, remember  that Christianity was born out of
  </p>
  <p>
   Judaism.
  </p>
  <p>
   "For eight centuries the Jews lived with the tension between the
  </p>
  <p>
   repeated pronouncements of prophets that the Day of the Lord was
  </p>
  <p>
   at hand and the continuing history of Israel. And still the
  </p>
  <p>
   followers of these prophets recorded, valued, and preserved the
  </p>
  <p>
   words of the prophets. Given that Jesus' followers looked upon
  </p>
  <p>
   him as being even greater than a prophet, it seems very
  </p>
  <p>
   reasonable that they would have done the same thing."
  </p>
  <p>
   While that did seem reasonable, some scholars have also raised a
  </p>
  <p>
   second objection that I wanted to pose to Blomberg. "They say
  </p>
  <p>
   that early Christians frequently believed that the physically
  </p>
  <p>
   departed Jesus was speaking through them with messages, or
  </p>
  <p>
   'prophecies,' for their church," I said. "Since these prophecies
  </p>
  <p>
   were considered as authoritative as Jesus' own words when he was
  </p>
  <p>
   alive on earth, the early Christians didn't distinguish between
  </p>
  <p>
   these newer sayings and the original words of the historical
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus. As a result, the gospels blend these two types of
  </p>
  <p>
   material, so we don't really know what goes back to the
  </p>
  <p>
   historical Jesus and what doesn't. That's a troubling charge to a
  </p>
  <p>
   lot of people. How do you respond to that?"

  <p>
   "That argument has less historical support than the previous
  </p>
  <p>
   one," he said with a smile. "In fact, within the New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   itself there is evidence that disproves this hypothesis.
  </p>
  <p>
   "There are occasions when early Christian prophecy is referred
  </p>
  <p>
   to, but it's always distinguished from what the Lord has said.
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, in I Corinthians 7 Paul clearly distinguishes when
  </p>
  <p>
   he has a word from the Lord and when he is quoting the historical
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus. In the book of Revelation one can clearly distinguish the
  </p>
  <p>
   handful of times in which Jesus directly speaks to this prophet-
  </p>
  <p>
   traditionally assumed to be John the apostle-and when John is
  </p>
  <p>
   recounting his own inspired visions."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And in 1 Corinthians 14, when Paul is discussing the criteria
  </p>
  <p>
   for true prophecy, he talks about the responsibility of the local
  </p>
  <p>
   church to test the prophets. Drawing on his Jewish background, we
  </p>
  <p>
   know that the criteria for true prophecy would have included
  </p>
  <p>
   whether the prediction  comes true and whether these new
  </p>
  <p>
   statements cohere with
  </p>
  <p>
   previously revealed words of the Lord.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the strongest argument is what we never find in the gospels.
  </p>
  <p>
   After Jesus' ascension there were a number of controversies that
  </p>
  <p>
   threatened the early church-should believers be circumcised, how
  </p>
  <p>
   should speaking in tongues be regulated, how to keep Jew and
  </p>
  <p>
   Gentile  united, what are the appropriate roles for women in
  </p>
  <p>
   ministry, whether believers could divorce non-Christian spouses.
  </p>
  <p>
   These issues could have been conveniently resolved if the early
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians had simply read back into the gospels what Jesus had
  </p>
  <p>
   told them from the world beyond. But this never happened. The
  </p>
  <p>
   continuance  of these controversies demonstrates that Christians
  </p>
  <p>
   were interested  in distinguishing between what happened during
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' lifetime and what was debated later in the churches."

   2. THE ABILITY TEST

  <p>
   Even if the writers intended to reliably record history, were
  </p>
  <p>
   they able to do so? How can we be sure that the material about
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' life and teachings was well preserved for thirty years
  </p>
  <p>
   before it was finally written  down in the gospels?
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked Blomberg, "Won't you concede that faulty memories,
  </p>
  <p>
   wishful thinking, and the development of legend would have
  </p>
  <p>
   irreparably contaminated the Jesus tradition prior to the writing
  </p>
  <p>
   of the gospels?" He started his answer by establishing the
  </p>
  <p>
   context. "We have to remember that we're in a foreign land in a
  </p>
  <p>
   distant time and place and in a culture that has not yet invented
  </p>
  <p>
   computers or even the printing press," he replied. "Books-or
