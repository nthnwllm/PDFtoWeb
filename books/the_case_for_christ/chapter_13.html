  <p>
   to the canonical gospels. Jesus says, 'Split wood; I am there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lift up a stone, and you will find me there.' That's pantheism,
  </p>
  <p>
   the idea that Jesus is coterminous with the substance of this
  </p>
  <p>
   world. That's contrary to anything in the canonical gospels.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The Gospel of Thomas ends with a note saying, 'Let Mary go away
  </p>
  <p>
   from us, because women are not worthy of life.'Jesus is quoted as
  </p>
  <p>
   saying, 'Lo, I shall lead her in order to make her a male, so
  </p>
  <p>
   that she too may become a living spirit, resembling you males.
  </p>
  <p>
   For every woman who makes herself male will enter into the
  </p>
  <p>
   kingdom of heaven.'" Metzger's eyebrows shot up as if he were
  </p>
  <p>
   surprised at what he had just uttered. "Now, this is not the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus we know from the four canonical  gospels!" he said
  </p>
  <p>
   emphatically.
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked, "What about the charge that Thomas was purposefully
  </p>
  <p>
   excluded by church councils in some sort of conspiracy to silence
  </p>
  <p>
   it?" "That's just not historically accurate," came Metzger's
  </p>
  <p>
   response. "What the synods and councils did in the fifth century
  </p>
  <p>
   and following was to ratify what already had been accepted by
  </p>
  <p>
   high and low Christians alike. It is not right to say that the
  </p>
  <p>
   Gospel of Thomas was excluded by some fiat on the part of a
  </p>
  <p>
   council; the right way to put it is, the Gospel of Thomas
  </p>
  <p>
   excluded itself! It did not harmonize with other testimony about
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus that early Christians accepted as trustworthy." "So you
  </p>
  <p>
   would disagree with anyone who would try to elevate Thomas to the
  </p>
  <p>
   same status as that of the four gospels?" I asked. "Yes, I would
  </p>
  <p>
   very much disagree. I think the early church exercised  a
  </p>
  <p>
   judicious act in discarding it. To take it up now, it seems to
  </p>
  <p>
   me, would be to accept something that's less valid than the other
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels," he replied. "Now, don't get me wrong. I think the
  </p>
  <p>
   Gospel of Thomas is an interesting document, but it's mixed up
  </p>
  <p>
   with pantheistic and antifeminist statements that certainly
  </p>
  <p>
   deserve to be given the left foot of fellowship, if you know what
  </p>
  <p>
   I mean.
  </p>
  <p>
   "You have to understand that the canon was not the result of a
  </p>
  <p>
   series of contests involving church politics. The canon is rather
  </p>
  <p>
   the separation that came about because of the intuitive insight
  </p>
  <p>
   of Christian  believers. They could hear the voice of the Good
  </p>
  <p>
   Shepherd in the gospel of John; they could hear it only in a
  </p>
  <p>
   muffled and distorted way in the Gospel of Thomas, mixed in with
  </p>
  <p>
   a lot of other things. "When the pronouncement was made about the
  </p>
  <p>
   canon, it merely ratified what the general sensitivity of the c
  </p>
  <p>
   'hurch had already determined.  You see, the canon is a list of
  </p>
  <p>
   authoritative books more than it is an authoritative list of
  </p>
  <p>
   books. These documents didn't derive their authority from being
  </p>
  <p>
   selected; each one was authoritative before anyone  gathered them
  </p>
  <p>
   together. The early church merely listened and sensed that these
  </p>
  <p>
   were authoritative accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
   "For somebody now to say that the canon emerged only after
  </p>
  <p>
   councils and synods made these pronouncements would be like
  </p>
  <p>
   saying,  'Let's get several academies of musicians to make a
  </p>
  <p>
   pronouncement  that the music of Bach and Beethoven is
  </p>
  <p>
   wonderful.' I would say, 'Thank you for nothing! We knew that
  </p>
  <p>
   before the pronouncement was made.' We know it because of
  </p>
  <p>
   sensitivity to what is good music and what is not. The same with
  </p>
  <p>
   the canon."
  </p>
  <p>
   Even so, I pointed out that some New Testament books, notably
  </p>
  <p>
   James, Hebrews, and Revelation, were more slowly accepted into
  </p>
  <p>
   the canon than others. "Should we therefore be suspicious of
  </p>
  <p>
   them?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "To my mind, that just shows how careful the early church was,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he replied. "They weren't 'gung ho,' sweeping in every last
  </p>
  <p>
   document that happened to have anything about Jesus in it. This
  </p>
  <p>
   shows deliberation  and careful analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Of course, even today parts of the Syrian church refuse to
  </p>
  <p>
   accept the book of Revelation, yet the people belonging to that
  </p>
  <p>
   church are Christian believers. From my point of view, I accept
  </p>
  <p>
   the book of Revelation  as a wonderful part of the Scriptures."
  </p>
  <p>
   He shook his head. "I think they impoverish themselves by not
  </p>
  <p>
   accepting it."
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE "UNRIVALED" NEW TESTAMENT
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Metzger had been persuasive. No serious doubts lingered
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning  whether the New Testament's text had been reliably
  </p>
  <p>
   preserved for us through the centuries. One of Metzger's
  </p>
  <p>
   distinguished predecessors  at Princeton Theological Seminary,
  </p>
  <p>
   Benjamin Warfield, who held four doctorates and taught systematic
  </p>
  <p>
   theology until his death in 1921, put it this way:
  </p>
  <p>
   If we compare the present state of the New Testament text with
  </p>
  <p>
   that of any other ancient writing, we must ... declare it to be
  </p>
  <p>
   marvelously correct. Such has been the care with which the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament has been copied-a care which has doubtless
  </p>
  <p>
   grown out of true reverence for its holy words.... The New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament [is] unrivaled among ancient writings in the purity of
  </p>
  <p>
   its text as actually transmitted and kept in use
  </p>
  <p>
   In terms of which documents were accepted into the New Testament,
  </p>
  <p>
   generally there has never been any serious dispute about the
  </p>
  <p>
   authoritative nature of twenty of the New Testament's twenty-
  </p>
  <p>
   seven books-from Matthew through Philemon, plus I Peter and I
  </p>
  <p>
   John. This of course includes the four gospels that represent
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' biographies.  The remaining seven books, though questioned
  </p>
  <p>
   for a time by some early church leaders, "were finally and fully
  </p>
  <p>
   recognized by the church generally," according to Geisler and
  </p>
  <p>
   Nix.  As for the "pseudepigraphia," the proliferation of gospels,
  </p>
  <p>
   epistles,  and apocalypses in the first few centuries after
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus-including  the Gospels of Nicodemus, Barnabas, Bartholomew,
  </p>
  <p>
   Andrew, the Epistle of Paul to the Laodiceans, the Apocalypse of
  </p>
  <p>
   Stephen, and others-they are "fanciful and heretical ... neither
  </p>
  <p>
   genuine nor valuable  as a whole," and "virtually no orthodox
  </p>
  <p>
   Father, canon or council"  considered them to be authoritative or
  </p>
  <p>
   deserving of inclusion in the New Testament."
  </p>
  <p>
   In fact, I accepted Metzger's challenge by reading many of them
  </p>
  <p>
   myself. Compared with the careful, sober, precise, eyewitness
  </p>
  <p>
   quality of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, these works truly
  </p>
  <p>
   deserve the description they received from Eusebius, the early
  </p>
  <p>
   church historian: "Totally absurd and impious." They were too far
  </p>
  <p>
   removed from Jesus' ministry to contribute anything meaningful to
  </p>
  <p>
   my investigation, having  been written as late as the fifth and
  </p>
  <p>
   sixth centuries, and their often mythical qualities disqualify
  </p>
  <p>
   them from being historically credible. With all that established,
  </p>
  <p>
   the time had arrived for my investigation  to advance to its next
  </p>
  <p>
   phase. I was curious: how much evidence is there for this
  </p>
  <p>
   miracle-working first-century carpenter outside the gospels? Do
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient historians confirm or contradict the New Testament's
  </p>
  <p>
   claims about his life, teachings, and miracles? I knew this
  </p>
  <p>
   required a trip to Ohio to visit one of the country's leading
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars in that field.
  </p>
  <p>
   As we stood, I thanked Dr. Metzger for his time and expertise. He
  </p>
  <p>
   smiled warmly and offered to walk me downstairs. I didn't want to
  </p>
  <p>
   consume any more of his Saturday afternoon, but my curiosity
  </p>
  <p>
   wouldn't let me leave Princeton without satisfying myself about
  </p>
  <p>
   one remaining issue.
  </p>
  <p>
   "All these decades of scholarship, of study, of writing
  </p>
  <p>
   textbooks, of delving into the minutiae of the New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   text-what has all this done to your personal faith?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Oh," he said, sounding happy to discuss the topic, "it has
  </p>
  <p>
   increased the basis of my personal faith to see the firmness with
  </p>
  <p>
   which these materials have come down to us, with a multiplicity
  </p>
  <p>
   of copies, some of which are very, very ancient."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So," I started to say, "scholarship has not diluted your faith-"
  </p>
  <p>
   He jumped in before I could finish my sentence. "On the
  </p>
  <p>
   contrary,"  he stressed, "it has built it. I've asked questions
  </p>
  <p>
   all my life, I've dug into the text, I've studied this
  </p>
  <p>
   thoroughly, and today I know with confidence that my trust in
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus has been well placed."
  </p>
  <p>
   He paused while his eyes surveyed my face. Then he added, for
  </p>
  <p>
   emphasis, "Very well placed."
  </p>
  <h2>
   Deliberations
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  Having read the interview with Dr. Metzger, how would you
  </p>
  <p>
   rate the reliability of the process by which the New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   was transmitted to us? What are some reasons you find this
  </p>
  <p>
   process trustworthy or not?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  Scan a copy of the New Testament and examine some of the
  </p>
  <p>
   notes in the margins that talk about variant readings. What are
  </p>
  <p>
   some examples you find? How does the presence of these notations
  </p>
  <p>
   affect your understanding of the passages?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.  Do the criteria for determining whether a document should be
  </p>
  <p>
   included in the New Testament seem reasonable? Why or why
  </p>
  <p>
   not? Are there other criteria you believe should be added? What
  </p>
  <p>
   disadvantages do modern scholars have in second-guessing the
  </p>
  <p>
   early church's decisions concerning whether a document should be
  </p>
  <p>
   included in the Bible?
