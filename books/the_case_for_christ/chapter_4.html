   Blomberg's books include Jesus and the Gospels; Interpreting the
  </p>
  <p>
   Parables; How Wide the Divide?; and commentaries on the gospel of
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew and I Corinthians. He also helped edit volume six of
  </p>
  <p>
   Gospel Perspectives, which deals at length with the miracles of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, and he coauthored Introduction to Biblical Interpretation.
  </p>
  <p>
   He contributed chapters on the historicity of the gospels to the
  </p>
  <p>
   book Reasonable Faith and the award-winning Jesus under Fire. His
  </p>
  <p>
   memberships include the Society for the Study of the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament, Society of Biblical Literature, and the Institute for
  </p>
  <p>
   Biblical Research.
  </p>
  <p>
   As I expected, his office had more than its share of scholarly
  </p>
  <p>
   volumes  stacked on the shelves (he was even wearing a tie
  </p>
  <p>
   emblazoned with drawings of books).
  </p>
  <p>
   However, I quickly noted that his office walls were dominated not
  </p>
  <p>
   by dusty tomes from ancient historians but by artwork from his
  </p>
  <p>
   young daughters. Their whimsical and colorful depictions of
  </p>
  <p>
   llamas, houses, and flowers weren't haphazardly pinned up as a
  </p>
  <p>
   casual afterthought; they had obviously been treated as prizes -
  </p>
  <p>
   painstakingly matted, carefully framed, and personally
  </p>
  <p>
   autographed by Elizabeth and Rachel themselves. Clearly, I
  </p>
  <p>
   thought to myself, this man has a heart as well as a brain.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg speaks with the precision of a mathematician (yes, he
  </p>
  <p>
   taught mathematics too, earlier in his career), carefully
  </p>
  <p>
   measuring each word out of an apparent reluctance to tread even
  </p>
  <p>
   one nuance beyond where the evidence warrants. Exactly what I was
  </p>
  <p>
   looking for. As he settled into a high-back chair, cup of coffee
  </p>
  <p>
   in hand, I too sipped some coffee to ward off the Colorado chill.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since I sensed Blomberg was a get-to-the-point kind of guy, I
  </p>
  <p>
   decided to start my interview by cutting to the core of the
  </p>
  <p>
   issue.
  </p>
  <h2>
   EYEWITNESSES TO HISTORY
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Tell me this," I said with an edge of challenge in my voice, "is
  </p>
  <p>
   it really possible to be an intelligent, critically thinking
  </p>
  <p>
   person and still believe that the four gospels were written by
  </p>
  <p>
   the people whose names have been attached to them?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg set his cup of coffee on the edge of his desk and looked
  </p>
  <p>
   intently at me. "The answer is yes," he said with conviction. He
  </p>
  <p>
   sat back and continued. "It's important to acknowledge that
  </p>
  <p>
   strictly speaking, the gospels are anonymous. But the uniform
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony  of the early church was that Matthew, also known as
  </p>
  <p>
   Levi, the tax collector and one of the twelve disciples, was the
  </p>
  <p>
   author of the first gospel in the New Testament; that John Mark,
  </p>
  <p>
   a companion of Peter, was the author of the gospel we call Mark;
  </p>
  <p>
   and that Luke, known as Paul's 'beloved physician,' wrote both
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles."
  </p>
  <p>
   "How uniform was the belief that they were the authors?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "There are no known competitors for these three gospels," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said. "Apparently, it was just not in dispute."
  </p>
  <p>
   Even so, I wanted to test the issue further. "Excuse my
  </p>
  <p>
   skepticism,"  I said, "but would anyone have had a motivation to
  </p>
  <p>
   be achieved by claiming these people wrote these gospels, when
  </p>
  <p>
   they really didn't?" Blomberg shook his head. "Probably not.
  </p>
  <p>
   Remember, these were unlikely characters," he said, a grin
  </p>
  <p>
   breaking on his face. "Mark and Luke weren't even among the
  </p>
  <p>
   twelve disciples. Matthew was, but as a former hated tax
  </p>
  <p>
   collector, he would have been the most infamous character next to
  </p>
  <p>
   Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus!
  </p>
  <p>
   "Contrast this with what happened when the fanciful apocryphal
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels were written much later. People chose the names of well
  </p>
  <p>
   known  and exemplary figures to be their fictitious authors-
  </p>
  <p>
   Philip, Peter, Mary, James. Those names carried a lot more weight
  </p>
  <p>
   than the names of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. So to answer your
  </p>
  <p>
   question, there would not have been any reason to attribute
  </p>
  <p>
   authorship to these three less respected people if it weren't
  </p>
  <p>
   true."
  </p>
  <p>
   That sounded logical, but it was obvious that he was conveniently
  </p>
  <p>
   leaving out one of the gospel writers. "What about John?" I
  </p>
  <p>
   asked. "He was extremely prominent; in fact, he wasn't just one
  </p>
  <p>
   of the twelve disciples but one of Jesus' inner three, along with
  </p>
  <p>
   James and Peter."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, he's the one exception," Blomberg conceded with a nod. "And
  </p>
  <p>
   interestingly, John is the only gospel about which there is some
  </p>
  <p>
   question about authorship."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What exactly is in dispute?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "The name of the author isn't in doubt-it's certainly John,"
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg replied. "The question is whether it was John the
  </p>
  <p>
   apostle or a different John.
  </p>
  <p>
   "You see, the testimony of a Christian writer named Papias, dated
  </p>
  <p>
   about A.D. 125, refers to John the apostle and John the elder,
  </p>
  <p>
   and it's not clear from the context whether he's talking about
  </p>
  <p>
   one person from two perspectives or two different people. But
  </p>
  <p>
   granted that exception, the rest of the early testimony is
  </p>
  <p>
   unanimous that it was John the apostle-the  son of Zebedee-who
  </p>
  <p>
   wrote the gospel."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "And," I said in an effort to pin him down further, "you're
  </p>
  <p>
   convinced  that he did?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, I believe the substantial majority of the material goes
  </p>
  <p>
   back to the apostle," he replied. "However, if you read the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel closely, you can see some indication that its concluding
  </p>
  <p>
   verses may have been finalized by an editor. Personally, I have
  </p>
  <p>
   no problem believing that somebody closely associated with John
  </p>
  <p>
   may have functioned in that role, putting the last verses into
  </p>
  <p>
   shape and potentially creating the stylistic uniformity of the
  </p>
  <p>
   entire document.
  </p>
  <p>
   "But in any event," he stressed, "the gospel is obviously based
  </p>
  <p>
   on eyewitness material, as are the other three gospels."
  </p>
  <h2>
   DELVING INTO SPECIFICS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While I appreciated Blomberg's comments so far, I wasn't ready to
  </p>
  <p>
   move on yet. The issue of who wrote the gospels is tremendously
  </p>
  <p>
   important, and I wanted specific details-names, dates,
  </p>
  <p>
   quotations. I finished off my coffee and put the cup on his desk.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pen poised, I prepared to dig deeper.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let's go back to Mark, Matthew, and Luke," I said. "What
  </p>
  <p>
   specific  evidence do you have that they are the authors of the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels?" Blomberg leaned forward. "Again, the oldest and
  </p>
  <p>
   probably most significant testimony comes from Papias, who in
  </p>
  <p>
   about A.D. 125 specifically affirmed that Mark had carefully and
  </p>
  <p>
   accurately recorded Peter's eyewitness observations. In fact, he
  </p>
  <p>
   said Mark 'made no mistake'  and did not include 'any false
  </p>
  <p>
   statement.' And Papias said Matthew had preserved the teachings
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Then Irenaeus, writing about A.D. 180, confirmed the traditional
  </p>
  <p>
   authorship. In fact, here-," he said, reaching for a book. He
  </p>
  <p>
   flipped it open and read Irenaeus' words.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew published his own Gospel among the Hebrews in
  </p>
  <p>
   their own tongue, when Peter and Paul were preaching the
  </p>
  <p>
   Gospel in Rome and founding the church there. After their
  </p>
  <p>
   departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, himself
  </p>
  <p>
   handed down to us in writing the substance of Peter's preaching.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luke, the follower of Paul, set down in a book the Gospel
  </p>
  <p>
   preached by his teacher. Then John, the disciple of the Lord, who
  </p>
  <p>
   also leaned on his breast, himself produced his Gospel
  </p>
  <p>
   while he was living at Ephesus in Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
   I looked up from the notes I was taking. "OK, let me clarify
  </p>
  <p>
   this," I said. "If we can have confidence that the gospels were
  </p>
  <p>
   written by the disciples Matthew and John, by Mark, the companion
  </p>
  <p>
   of the disciple Peter, and by Luke, the historian, companion of
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul, and sort of a first-century journalist, we can be assured
  </p>
  <p>
   that the events they record are based on either direct or
  </p>
  <p>
   indirect eyewitness testimony." As I was speaking, Blomberg was
  </p>
  <p>
   mentally sifting my words.
  </p>
  <p>
   When I finished, he nodded.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Exactly," he said crisply.
  </p>
  <h2>
   ANCIENT VERSUS MODERN BIOGRAPHIES
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   There were still some troubling aspects of the gospels that I
  </p>
  <p>
   needed to clarify. In particular, I wanted to better understand
  </p>
  <p>
   the kind of literary  genre they represented.
  </p>
  <p>
   "When I go to the bookstore and look in the biography section, I
  </p>
  <p>
   don't see the same kind of writing that I see in the gospels," I
  </p>
  <p>
   said. "When somebody writes a biography these days, they
  </p>
  <p>
   thoroughly delve into the person's life. But look at Mark-he
  </p>
  <p>
   doesn't talk about the birth of Jesus or really anything through
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' early adult years. Instead he focuses on a three-year
  </p>
  <p>
   period and spends half his gospel on the events leading up to and
  </p>
  <p>
   culminating in Jesus' last week. How do you explain that?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg held up a couple of fingers. "There are two reasons," he
  </p>
  <p>
   replied. "One is literary and the other is theological.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The literary reason is that basically, this is how people wrote
  </p>
  <p>
   biographies in the ancient world. They did not have the sense, as
  </p>
  <p>
   we do today, that it was important to give equal proportion to
  </p>
  <p>
   all periods of an individual's life or that it was necessary to
  </p>
  <p>
   tell the story in strictly chronological order or even to quote
  </p>
  <p>
   people verbatim, as long as the essence of what they said was
  </p>
  <p>
   preserved. Ancient Greek and Hebrew didn't even have a symbol for

   "The only purpose for which they thought history was worth
  </p>
  <p>
   recording was because there were some lessons to be learned from
  </p>
  <p>
   the characters described. Therefore the biographer wanted to
  </p>
  <p>
   dwell at length on those portions of the person's life that were
  </p>
  <p>
   exemplary, that were illustrative, that could help other people,
  </p>
  <p>
   that gave meaning to a period of history."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And what's the theological reason?" I asked.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "It flows out of the point I just made. Christians believe that
  </p>
  <p>
   as wonderful as Jesus' life and teachings and miracles were, they
  </p>
  <p>
   were meaningless if it were not historically factual that Christ
  </p>
  <p>
   died and was raised from the dead and that this provided
  </p>
  <p>
   atonement, or forgiveness,  of the sins of humanity.

   "So Mark in particular, as the writer of probably the earliest

  <p>
   gospel, devotes roughly half his narrative to the events leading

  </p>
  <p>
   Christ's death and resurrection.

   "Given the significance of the Crucifixion," he concluded, "this

  <h2>
   THE MYSTERY OF Q
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   In addition to the four gospels, scholars often refer to what
  </p>
  <p>
   they call Q, which stands for the German word Quelle, or
  </p>
  <p>
   "source."' Because of similarities in language and content, it
  </p>
  <p>
   has traditionally been assumed that Matthew and Luke drew upon
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark's earlier gospel in writing their own. In addition, scholars
  </p>
  <p>
   have said that Matthew and Luke also incorporated some material
  </p>
  <p>
   from this mysterious Q, material  that is absent from Mark.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What exactly is Q?" I asked Blomberg.
  </p>
  <p>
   'It's nothing more than a hypothesis," he replied, again leaning
  </p>
  <p>
   back comfortably in his chair. "With few exceptions, it's just
  </p>
  <p>
   sayings or teachings of Jesus, which once may have formed an
  </p>
  <p>
   independent, separate document.
  </p>
  <p>
   4'You see, it was a common literary genre to collect the sayings
  </p>
  <p>
   of respected teachers, sort of as we compile the top music of a
  </p>
  <p>
   singer and put it into a 'best of' album. Q may have been
  </p>
  <p>
   something like that. At least that's the theory."
  </p>
  <p>
   But if Q existed before Matthew and Luke, it would constitute
  </p>
  <p>
   early material about Jesus. Perhaps, I thought, it can shed some
  </p>
  <p>
   fresh light on what Jesus was really like.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me ask this," I said. "If you isolate just the material from
  </p>
  <p>
   Q, what kind of picture of Jesus do you get?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg stroked his beard and stared at the ceiling for a moment
  </p>
  <p>
   as he pondered the question. "Well, you have to keep in mind that
  </p>
  <p>
   Q was a collection of sayings, and therefore it didn't have the
  </p>
  <p>
   narrative material that would have given us a more fully orbed
