  <p>
   It's also interesting that Paul doesn't mention some of the
  </p>
  <p>
   things that are highly significant in the gospels-for instance,
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' parables  and miracles-but he focuses on Jesus' atoning
  </p>
  <p>
   death and resurrection.  Those, for Paul, were the most important
  </p>
  <p>
   things about
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus-and indeed they transformed Paul from being a persecutor of
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians into becoming history's foremost Christian missionary,
  </p>
  <p>
   who was willing to go through all sorts of hardships and
  </p>
  <p>
   deprivation because of his faith.
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul also corroborates some important aspects of the character of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus-his humility, his obedience, his love for sinners, and so
  </p>
  <p>
   forth. He calls Christians to have the mind of Christ in the
  </p>
  <p>
   second chapter of Philippians. This is a famous passage in which
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul is probably quoting from an early Christian hymn about the
  </p>
  <p>
   emptying of Christ, who was equal to God yet took the form of a
  </p>
  <p>
   man, of a slave, and suffered the extreme penalty, the
  </p>
  <p>
   Crucifixion. So Paul's letters are an important witness to the
  </p>
  <p>
   deity of Christ-he calls Jesus 'the Son of God' and 'the image of
  </p>
  <p>
   God."
  </p>
  <p>
   I interrupted by saying, "The fact that Paul, who came from a
  </p>
  <p>
   monotheistic Jewish background, worshiped Jesus as God is
  </p>
  <p>
   extremely significant, isn't it?"
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Yes," he said, "and it undermines a popular theory that the
  </p>
  <p>
   deity of Christ was later imported into Christianity by Gentile
  </p>
  <p>
   beliefs. It's just not so. Even Paul at this very early date was
  </p>
  <p>
   worshiping Jesus as God. I have to say that all this
  </p>
  <p>
   corroboration by Paul is of the utmost importance. And we have
  </p>
  <p>
   other early letters by the eyewitnesses James and Peter, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   James, for instance, has recollections of Jesus' Sermon on the
  </p>
  <p>
   Mount."
  </p>
  <h2>
   TRULY RAISED FROM THE DEAD
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   We also have volumes of writings by the "apostolic fathers," who
  </p>
  <p>
   were the earliest Christian writers after the New Testament. They
  </p>
  <p>
   authored the Epistle of Clement of Rome, the Epistles of
  </p>
  <p>
   Ignatius, the Epistle of Polycarp, the Epistle of Barnabas, and
  </p>
  <p>
   others. In many places these writings attest to the basic facts
  </p>
  <p>
   about Jesus, particularly his teachings,  his crucifixion, his
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection, and his divine nature.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Which of these writings do you consider most significant?" I
  </p>
  <p>
   asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi pondered the question. While he didn't name the one he
  </p>
  <p>
   thought was most significant, he did cite the seven letters of
  </p>
  <p>
   Ignatius as being among the most important of the writings of the
  </p>
  <p>
   apostolic fathers. Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch in Syria, was
  </p>
  <p>
   martyred  during the reign of Trajan before A.D. 117.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What is significant about Ignatius," said Yamauchi, "is that he
  </p>
  <p>
   emphasized both the deity of Jesus and the humanity of Jesus, as
  </p>
  <p>
   against the docetic heresy, which denied that Jesus was really
  </p>
  <p>
   human. He also stressed the historical underpinnings of
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity; he wrote in one letter, on his way to being
  </p>
  <p>
   executed, that Jesus was truly persecuted  under Pilate, was
  </p>
  <p>
   truly crucified, was truly raised from the dead, and that those
  </p>
  <p>
   who believe in him would be raised, too. Put all this together-
  </p>
  <p>
   Josephus, the Roman historians and officials,  the Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   writings, the letters of Paul and the apostolic fathers-and
  </p>
  <p>
   you've got persuasive evidence that corroborates all the
  </p>
  <p>
   essentials found in the biographies of Jesus. Even if you were to
  </p>
  <p>
   throw away every last copy of the gospels, you'd still have a
  </p>
  <p>
   picture of Jesus that's extremely compelling-in fact, it's a
  </p>
  <p>
   portrait of the unique Son of God."
  </p>
  <p>
   I stood and thanked Yamauchi for sharing his time and expertise.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I know there's a lot more we could talk about, since entire
  </p>
  <p>
   books have been written on this topic," I said. "But before we
  </p>
  <p>
   end, I'd like to ask you one last question. A personal one, if
  </p>
  <p>
   that's all right." The professor rose to his feet. "Yes, that's
  </p>
  <p>
   fine," he said. I glanced around his modest office, which was
  </p>
  <p>
   filled to the brim with books and manuscripts, records and
  </p>
  <p>
   journals, computer disks and papers, all products of a lifetime
  </p>
  <p>
   of scholarly research into a world of long ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   "You've spent forty years studying ancient history and
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeology,"  I said. "What has been the result in your own
  </p>
  <p>
   spiritual life? Have your studies bolstered or weakened your
  </p>
  <p>
   faith in Jesus Christ?" He looked down at the floor momentarily,
  </p>
  <p>
   then raised his eyes and looked squarely into mine. He said in a
  </p>
  <p>
   firm but sincere voice, "There's no question-my studies have
  </p>
  <p>
   greatly strengthened and enriched my spiritual life. They have
  </p>
  <p>
   given me a better understanding  of the culture and historical
  </p>
  <p>
   context of the events.
  </p>
  <p>
   "This doesn't mean that I don't recognize that there are some
  </p>
  <p>
   issues that still remain; within this lifetime we will not have
  </p>
  <p>
   full knowledge. But these issues don't even begin to undermine my
  </p>
  <p>
   faith in the essential trustworthiness of the gospels and the
  </p>
  <p>
   rest of the New Testament.
  </p>
  <p>
   I think the alternative explanations, which try to account for
  </p>
  <p>
   the spread of Christianity through sociological or psychological
  </p>
  <p>
   reasons, are very weak." He shook his head. "Very weak."
  </p>
  <p>
   Then he added, "For me, the historical evidence has reinforced my
  </p>
  <p>
   commitment to Jesus Christ as the Son of God who loves us and
  </p>
  <p>
   died for us and was raised from the dead. It's that simple."
  </p>
  <h2>
   TRUTH THAT SETS US FREE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   As I emerged from Yamauchi's building into a sea of college
  </p>
  <p>
   students scurrying from place to place in order to make their
  </p>
  <p>
   next class, I reflected on how satisfying my drive to tiny
  </p>
  <p>
   Oxford, Ohio, had been. I came seeking corroboration for Jesus,
  </p>
  <p>
   and I walked away with a rich reservoir of material affirming
  </p>
  <p>
   every major aspect of his life, miracles,  deity, and victory
  </p>
  <p>
   over death.
  </p>
  <p>
   I knew that our brief conversation had only scratched the
  </p>
  <p>
   surface.  Under my arm I was carrying The Verdict ofHistory,
  </p>
  <p>
   which I had reread in preparation for my interview. In it
  </p>
  <p>
   historian Gary Habermas details a total of thirty-nine ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   sources documenting the life of Jesus, from which he enumerates
  </p>
  <p>
   more than one hundred reported facts concerning Jesus' life,
  </p>
  <p>
   teachings, crucifixion, and resurrection. What's more, twenty-
  </p>
  <p>
   four of the sources cited by Habermas,
  </p>
  <p>
   including seven secular sources and several of the earliest
  </p>
  <p>
   creeds of the church, specifically concern the divine nature of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus. "These creeds reveal that the church did not simply teach
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' deity a generation  later, as is so often repeated in
  </p>
  <p>
   contemporary theology,
  </p>
  <p>
   because this doctrine is definitely present in the earliest
  </p>
  <p>
   church," Habermas writes. His conclusion: "The best explanation
  </p>
  <p>
   for these creeds is that they properly represent Jesus' own
  </p>
  <p>
   teachings    ." That is stunning corroboration for the most
  </p>
  <p>
   important assertion by the most influential individual who has
  </p>
  <p>
   ever lived.
  </p>
  <p>
   I zipped up my coat as I headed for my car. Glancing back one
  </p>
  <p>
   more time, I saw the October sun illuminating the stone
  </p>
  <p>
   inscription I had first noticed when I walked onto the campus of
  </p>
  <p>
   this thoroughly secular university:  "Ye shall know the truth,
  </p>
  <p>
   and the truth will make you free."

  <p>
   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1 .Is there an incident in your life in which you doubted
  </p>
  <p>
   someone's story until he or she offered some corroborating
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence? How was that experience similar to learning about the
  </p>
  <p>
   kind of corroborative  evidence that Yamauchi presented?
  </p>
  <p>
   2. What do you consider to be the most persuasive corroboration
  </p>
  <p>
   that Yamauchi talked about? Why?
  </p>
  <p>
   3. Ancient sources say that early Christians clung to their
  </p>
  <p>
   beliefs rather than disavow them in the face of torture. Why do
  </p>
  <p>
   you think they had such strongly held convictions?

   5: THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Does Archaeology Confirm or Contradict Jesus-'Biographies?
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   There was something surreal about my lunch with Dr. Jeffrey
  </p>
  <p>
   MacDonald. There he was, casually munching on a tuna fish
  </p>
  <p>
   sandwich  and potato chips in a conference room of a North
  </p>
  <p>
   Carolina
  </p>
  <p>
   courthouse, making upbeat comments and generally enjoying himself
  </p>
  <p>
   In a nearby room a dozen jurors were taking a break after hearing
  </p>
  <p>
   gruesome evidence that MacDonald had brutally murdered his wife
  </p>
  <p>
   and two young daughters.
  </p>
  <p>
   As we were finishing our meal, I couldn't restrain myself from
  </p>
  <p>
   asking MacDonald the obvious questions. "How can you act as if
  </p>
  <p>
   nothing is wrong?" I said, my voice mixed with astonishment and
  </p>
  <p>
   indignation. "Aren't you the slightest bit concerned that those
  </p>
  <p>
   jurors are going to find you guilty?"
  </p>
  <p>
   MacDonald casually waved his half-eaten sandwich in the general
  </p>
  <p>
   direction of the jury room. "Them?" he chortled. "They'll never
  </p>
  <p>
   convict me!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, apparently realizing how cynical those words sounded, he
  </p>
  <p>
   quickly added, "I'm innocent, you know."
  </p>
  <p>
   That was the last time I ever heard him laugh. Within days the
  </p>
  <p>
   former Green Beret and emergency room physician was found guilty
  </p>
  <p>
   of stabbing to death his wife, Colette, and his daughters,
  </p>
  <p>
   Kimberly, age five, and Kristen, age two. He was promptly
  </p>
  <p>
   sentenced to life in prison and carted off in handcuffs.
  </p>
  <p>
   MacDonald, whose story was masterfully recounted by Joe
  </p>
  <p>
   McGinniss in the best-seller and TV movie Fatal Vision, was cocky
  </p>
  <p>
   enough to think that his alibi would help him get away with
  </p>
  <p>
   murder. He had told investigators that he was asleep on the couch
  </p>
  <p>
   when drug-crazed hippies awakened him in the middle of the night.
  </p>
  <p>
   He said he fought them off, getting stabbed and knocked
  </p>
  <p>
   unconscious in the process. When he awakened, he found his family
  </p>
  <p>
   slaughtered. Detectives were skeptical from the start. The living
  </p>
  <p>
   room showed few signs of a life-and-death struggle. MacDonald's
  </p>
  <p>
   wounds were superficial. Though he had poor eyesight, he was
  </p>
  <p>
   somehow able to provide detailed descriptions of his attackers
  </p>
  <p>
   even though he had not been wearing his glasses.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, skepticism alone doesn't win convictions; that requires
  </p>
  <p>
   hard evidence. In MacDonald's case detectives relied on
  </p>
  <p>
   scientific proof to untangle his web of lies and convict him of
  </p>
  <p>
   the slayings. There's a wide variety of scientific evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   that's commonly used in trials, ranging from DNA typing to
  </p>
  <p>
   forensic anthropology to toxicology.  In MacDonald's case it was
  </p>
  <p>
   serology (blood evidence) and
  </p>
  <p>
   trace evidence that dispatched him to the penitentiary.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an extraordinary-and for prosecutors, fortuitous coincidence,
  </p>
  <p>
   each member of MacDonald's family had a different blood
  </p>
  <p>
   type. By analyzing where bloodstains were found, investigators
  </p>
  <p>
   were able to reconstruct the sequence of events that deadly
  </p>
  <p>
   evening-and it directly contradicted MacDonald's version of what
  </p>
  <p>
   happened. Scientific study of tiny blue pajama threads, which
  </p>
  <p>
   were found scattered in various locations, also refuted his
  </p>
  <p>
   alibi. And microscopic analysis demonstrated that holes in his
  </p>
  <p>
   pajamas could not have been made, as he claimed, by an ice pick
  </p>
  <p>
   wielded by the home invaders. In short, it was FBI technicians in
  </p>
  <p>
   white lab coats who were really behind MacDonald's conviction.

  <p>
   Scientific evidence can also make important contributions to the
