   Holocaust. But it has been the Jewish scholars  who've created
  </p>
  <p>
   museums, written books, preserved artifacts, and documented
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitness testimony concerning the Holocaust."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Now, they have a very ideological purpose-namely, to ensure that
  </p>
  <p>
   such an atrocity never occurs again-but they have also been the
  </p>
  <p>
   most faithful and objective in their reporting of historical
  </p>
  <p>
   truth."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Christianity was likewise based on certain historical claims
  </p>
  <p>
   that God uniquely entered into space and time in the person of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus of Nazareth, so the very ideology that Christians were
  </p>
  <p>
   trying to promote required as careful historical work as
  </p>
  <p>
   possible."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   He let his analogy sink in. Turning to face me more directly, he
  </p>
  <p>
   asked, "Do you see my point?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I nodded to indicate that I did.
  </p>
  <h2>
   HOT NEWS FROM HISTORY
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   It's one thing to say that the gospels are rooted in direct or
  </p>
  <p>
   indirect eyewitness testimony; it's another to claim that this
  </p>
  <p>
   information was reliably preserved until it was finally written
  </p>
  <p>
   down years later. This, I knew, was a major point of contention,
  </p>
  <p>
   and I wanted to challenge Blomberg with this issue as
  </p>
  <p>
   forthrightly as I could.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again I picked up Armstrong's popular book A History of God.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Listen to something else she wrote," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "'We know very little about Jesus. The first full-length account
  </p>
  <p>
   of his life was St. Mark's gospel, which was not written until
  </p>
  <p>
   about the year 70, some forty years after his death. By that
  </p>
  <p>
   time, historical facts had been overlaid with mythical elements
  </p>
  <p>
   which expressed the meaning Jesus had acquired for his followers.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is this meaning that St. Mark primarily conveys
  </p>
  <p>
   rather than a reliable straightforward portrayal .'"
  </p>
  <p>
   Tossing the book back into my open briefcase, I turned to
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg and continued. "Some scholars say the gospels were
  </p>
  <p>
   written  so far after the events that legend developed and
  </p>
  <p>
   distorted what was finally written down, turning Jesus from
  </p>
  <p>
   merely a wise teacher into the mythological Son of God. Is that a
  </p>
  <p>
   reasonable hypothesis, or is there good evidence that the gospels
  </p>
  <p>
   were recorded earlier than that, before legend could totally
  </p>
  <p>
   corrupt what was ultimately recorded?"
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Blomberg's eyes narrowed, and his voice took on an adamant
  </p>
  <p>
   tone. "There are two separate issues here, and it's important to
  </p>
  <p>
   keep them separate," he said. "I do think there's good evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   for suggesting  early dates for the writing of the gospels. But
  </p>
  <p>
   even if there wasn't, Armstrong's argument doesn't work anyway."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Why not?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   'The standard scholarly dating, even in very liberal circles, is
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark in the 70s, Matthew and Luke in the 80s, John in the 90s.
  </p>
  <p>
   But listen: that's still within the lifetimes of various
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitnesses of the life of Jesus, including hostile eyewitnesses
  </p>
  <p>
   who would have served as a corrective if false teachings about
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus were going around. "Consequently, these late dates for the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels really aren't all that late. In fact, we can make a
  </p>
  <p>
   comparison that's very instructive. "The two earliest biographies
  </p>
  <p>
   of Alexander the Great were written by Arrian and Plutarch more
  </p>
  <p>
   than four hundred years after Alexander's  death in 323 B.C., yet
  </p>
  <p>
   historians consider them to be generally trustworthy. Yes,
  </p>
  <p>
   legendary material about Alexander did develop over time, but it
  </p>
  <p>
   was only in the centuries after these two writers. "In other
  </p>
  <p>
   words, the first five hundred years kept Alexander's story pretty
  </p>
  <p>
   much intact; legendary material began to emerge over the next
  </p>
  <p>
   five hundred years. So whether the gospels were written sixty
  </p>
  <p>
   years or thirty years after the life of Jesus, the amount of time
  </p>
  <p>
   is negligible  by comparison. It's almost a nonissue."
  </p>
  <p>
   I could see what Blomberg was saying. At the same time, I had
  </p>
  <p>
   some reservations about it. To me, it seemed intuitively obvious
  </p>
  <p>
   that the shorter the gap between an event and when it was
  </p>
  <p>
   recorded in writing, the less likely those writings would fall
  </p>
  <p>
   victim to legend or faulty memories.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me concede your point for the moment, but let's get back to
  </p>
  <p>
   the dating of the gospels," I said. "You indicated that you
  </p>
  <p>
   believe they were written sooner than the dates you mentioned."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, sooner," he said. "And we can support that by looking at
  </p>
  <p>
   the book of Acts, which was written by Luke. Acts ends apparently
  </p>
  <p>
   unfinished-Paul  is a central figure of the book, and he's under
  </p>
  <p>
   house
  </p>
  <p>
   arrest in Rome. With that the book abruptly halts. What happens
  </p>
  <p>
   to Paul? We don't find out from Acts, probably because the book
  </p>
  <p>
   was written before Paul was put to death."
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg was getting more wound up as he went. "That means
  </p>
  <p>
   Acts cannot be dated any later than A.D. 62. Having established
  </p>
  <p>
   that, we can then move backward from there. Since Acts is the
  </p>
  <p>
   second of a two-part work, we know the first part-the gospel of
  </p>
  <p>
   Luke-must have been written earlier than that. And since Luke
  </p>
  <p>
   incorporates parts of the gospel of Mark, that means Mark is even
  </p>
  <p>
   earlier. "If you allow maybe a year for each of those, you end up
  </p>
  <p>
   with Mark written no later than about A.D. 60, maybe even the
  </p>
  <p>
   late 50s. If Jesus was put to death in A.D. 30 or 33, we're
  </p>
  <p>
   talking about a maximum  gap of thirty years or so."
  </p>
  <p>
   He sat back in his chair with an air of triumph. "Historically
  </p>
  <p>
   speaking, especially compared with Alexander the Great," he said,
  </p>
  <p>
   "that's like a news flash!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, that was impressive, closing the gap between the events
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus' life and the writing of the gospels to the point where
  </p>
  <p>
   it was negligible by historical standards. However, I still
  </p>
  <p>
   wanted to push the issue. My goal was to turn the clock back as
  </p>
  <p>
   far as I could to get to the very earliest information about
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus.
  </p>
  <h2>
   GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I stood and strolled over to the bookcase. "Let's see if we can
  </p>
  <p>
   go back even further," I said, turning toward Blomberg. "How
  </p>
  <p>
   early can we date the fundamental beliefs in Jesus' atonement,
  </p>
  <p>
   his resurrection, and his unique association with God?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "It's important to remember that the books of the New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   are not in chronological order," he began. "The gospels were
  </p>
  <p>
   written after almost all the letters of Paul, whose writing
  </p>
  <p>
   ministry probably began in the late 40s. Most of his major
  </p>
  <p>
   letters appeared during the 50s. To find the earliest
  </p>
  <p>
   information, one goes to Paul's epistles and then asks, 'Are
  </p>
  <p>
   there signs that even earlier sources were used in writing
  </p>
  <p>
   them?"'
  </p>
  <p>
   "And," I prompted, "what do we find?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "We find that Paul incorporated some creeds, confessions of
  </p>
  <p>
   faith, or hymns from the earliest Christian church. These go way
  </p>
  <p>
   back to the dawning of the church soon after the Resurrection.
  </p>
  <p>
   The most famous creeds include Philippians 2:6-11, which
  </p>
  <p>
   talks"about Jesus being 'in very nature God,' and Colossians
  </p>
  <p>
   1:15-20, which describes him as being 'the image of the invisible
  </p>
  <p>
   God,' who created all things and through whom all things are
  </p>
  <p>
   reconciled with God 'by making peace through his blood, shed on
  </p>
  <p>
   the cross.'
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Those are certainly significant in explaining what the earliest
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians were convinced about Jesus. But perhaps the most
  </p>
  <p>
   important  creed in terms of the historical Jesus is 1
  </p>
  <p>
   Corinthians 15, where Paul uses technical language to indicate he
  </p>
  <p>
   was passing along this oral tradition in relatively fixed form."
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg located the passage in his Bible and read it to me. "For
  </p>
  <p>
   what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the
  </p>
  <p>
   brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though
  </p>
  <p>
   some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James,
  </p>
  <p>
   then to all the apostles. "
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "And here's the point," Blomberg said. "If the Crucifixion was as
  </p>
  <p>
   early as A.D. 30, Paul's conversion was about 32. Immediately
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul was ushered into Damascus, where he met with a Christian
  </p>
  <p>
   named Ananias and some other disciples. His first meeting with
  </p>
  <p>
   the apostles  in Jerusalem would have been about A.D. 35. At some
  </p>
  <p>
   point along there, Paul was given this creed, which had already
  </p>
  <p>
   been formulated and was being used in the early church.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Now, here you have the key facts about Jesus' death for our
  </p>
  <p>
   sins, plus a detailed list of those to whom he appeared in
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrected form-all dating back to within two to five years of
  </p>
  <p>
   the events themselves!
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "That's not later mythology from forty or more years down the
  </p>
  <p>
   road, as Armstrong suggested. A good case can be made for saying
  </p>
  <p>
   that Christian belief in the Resurrection, though not yet written
  </p>
  <p>
   down, can be dated to within two years of that very event.
  </p>
  <p>
   "This is enormously significant," he said, his voice rising a bit
  </p>
  <p>
   in emphasis. "Now you're not comparing thirty to sixty years with
  </p>
  <p>
   the five hundred years that's generally acceptable for other
  </p>
  <p>
   data-you're talking about two!"
  </p>
  <p>
   I couldn't deny the importance of that evidence. It certainly
  </p>
  <p>
   seemed to take the wind out of the charge that the Resurrection -
  </p>
  <p>
   which  is cited by Christians as the crowning confirmation of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' divinity-was merely a mythological concept that developed
  </p>
  <p>
   over long periods of time as legends corrupted the eyewitness
  </p>
  <p>
   accounts of Christ's life. For me, this struck especially close
  </p>
  <p>
   to home-as a skeptic,  that was one of my biggest objections to
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity.
  </p>
  <p>
   I leaned against the bookcase. We had covered a lot of material,
  </p>
  <p>
   and Blomberg's climactic assertion seemed like a good place to
  </p>
  <p>
   pause.

   A SHORT RECESS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   It was getting late in the afternoon. We had been talking for
  </p>
  <p>
   quite a while without a break. However, I didn't want to end our
  </p>
  <p>
   conversation Without putting the eyewitness accounts to the same
  </p>
  <p>
   kind of tests to which a lawyer or journalist would subject them.
  </p>
  <p>
   I needed to know: would they stand up under that scrutiny, or
  </p>
  <p>
   would they be exposed as questionable at best or unreliable at
  </p>
  <p>
   worst?
  </p>
  <p>
   The necessary groundwork having been laid, I invited Blomberg to
  </p>
  <p>
   stand and stretch his legs before we sat back down to resume our
  </p>
  <p>
   discussion.

   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.   How have your opinions been influenced by someone's
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitness account of an event? What are some factors you
  </p>
  <p>
   routinely use to evaluate whether someone's story is honest and
  </p>
  <p>
   accurate? How do you think the gospels would stand up to that
  </p>
  <p>
   kind of scrutiny? 2.   Do you believe that the gospels can have a
  </p>
  <p>
   theological agenda while at the same time being trustworthy in
  </p>
  <p>
   what they report? Why or why not? Do you find Blomberg's
  </p>
  <p>
   Holocaust analogy helpful in thinking through this issue?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.   How and why does Blomberg's description of the early
  </p>
  <p>
   information about Jesus affect your opinion about the reliability
  </p>
  <p>
   of the gospels? For Further Evidence
