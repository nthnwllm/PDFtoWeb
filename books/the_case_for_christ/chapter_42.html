   But I had heard the tapes of the debates for myself.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the face of the facts, they have been impotent to put Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   body back into the tomb. They flounder, they struggle, they
  </p>
  <p>
   snatch at straws, they contradict themselves, they pursue
  </p>
  <p>
   desperate and extraordinary  theories to try to account for the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence. Yet each time, in the end, the tomb remains vacant.
  </p>
  <p>
   I was reminded of the assessment by one of the towering legal
  </p>
  <p>
   intellects of all time, the Cambridge-educated Sir Norman
  </p>
  <p>
   Anderson, who lectured at Princeton University, was offered a
  </p>
  <p>
   professorship for life at Harvard University, and served as dean
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Faculty of Laws at the University of London.
  </p>
  <p>
   His conclusion, after a lifetime of analyzing this issue from a
  </p>
  <p>
   legal perspective, was summed up in one sentence: "The empty
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb, then, forms a veritable rock on which all rationalistic
  </p>
  <p>
   theories of the resurrection  dash themselves in vain."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <p>
   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  What's your own conclusion concerning whether Jesus' tomb was
  </p>
  <p>
   empty on Easter Morning? What evidence did you find most
  </p>
  <p>
   convincing  in coming to that judgment?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  As Craig pointed out, everyone in the ancient world admitted
  </p>
  <p>
   the tomb was empty; the issue was how it got that way. Can you
  </p>
  <p>
   think of any logical explanation for the vacant tomb other than
  </p>
  <p>
   the resurrection  of Jesus? if so, how do you imagine someone
  </p>
  <p>
   like Bill
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig might respond to your theory?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.  Read Mark 15:42-16:8, the earliest account of Jesus' burial
  </p>
  <p>
   and empty tomb. Do you agree with Craig that it is "stark in its
  </p>
  <p>
   simplicity  and unadorned by theological reflection"? Why or why
  </p>
  <p>
   not?

   13: THE EVIDENCE OF APPEARANCES
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Was jesus Seen Alive After His Death on the Cross
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1963 the body of fourteen-year-old Addie Mae Collins, one of
  </p>
  <p>
   four African-American girls tragically murdered in an infamous
  </p>
  <p>
   church bombing by white racists, was buried in Birmingham,
  </p>
  <p>
   Alabama. For years family members kept returning to the grave to
  </p>
  <p>
   pray and leave flowers. In 1998 they made the decision to
  </p>
  <p>
   disinter the deceased for reburial at another cemetery.
  </p>
  <p>
   When workers were sent to dig up the body, however, they
  </p>
  <p>
   returned with a shocking discovery: The grave was empty.
  </p>
  <p>
   Understandably, family members were terribly distraught. Hampered
  </p>
  <p>
   by poorly kept records, cemetery officials scrambled to figure
  </p>
  <p>
   out what had happened. Several possibilities were raised, the
  </p>
  <p>
   primary one being that her tombstone had been erected in the
  </p>
  <p>
   wrong place.' Yet in the midst of determining what happened, one
  </p>
  <p>
   explanation was never proposed: Nobody suggested that young Addie
  </p>
  <p>
   Mae had been resurrected to walk the earth again. Why? Because by
  </p>
  <p>
   itself an empty grave does not a resurrection make.
  </p>
  <p>
   My conversation with Dr. William Lane Craig has already elicited
  </p>
  <p>
   powerful evidence that the tomb of Jesus was empty the Sunday
  </p>
  <p>
   after his crucifixion. While I knew that this was important and
  </p>
  <p>
   necessary evidence for his resurrection, I was also aware that a
  </p>
  <p>
   missing body is not conclusive proof by itself. More facts would
  </p>
  <p>
   be needed to establish  that Jesus really did return from the
  </p>
  <p>
   dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   That's what prompted my plane trip to Virginia. As my flight
  </p>
  <p>
   gently  banked over the wooded hills below, I was doing some
  </p>
  <p>
   last-minute reading of a book by Michael Martin, the Boston
  </p>
  <p>
   University professor  who has sought to discredit Christianity. I
  </p>
  <p>
   smiled at his words:
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Perhaps the most sophisticated defense of the resurrection to
  </p>
  <p>
   date has been produced by Gary Habermas."
  </p>
  <p>
   I glanced at my watch. I would land with just enough time to rent
  </p>
  <p>
   a car, drive to Lynchburg, and make my two o'clock appointment
  </p>
  <p>
   with Habermas himself
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE TWELFTH INTERVIEW: GARY HABERMAS, PH.D, D.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Two autographed photos of hockey players, shown in flat-out
  </p>
  <p>
   combat on ice, hang on the walls of Habermas's austere office.
  </p>
  <p>
   One features the immortal Bobby Hull of the Chicago Blackhawks;
  </p>
  <p>
   the other depicts Dave "The Hammer" Schultz, the brawling, tough-
  </p>
  <p>
   as-nails forward for the Philadelphia Flyers.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Hull is my favorite hockey player," explains Habermas. "Schultz
  </p>
  <p>
   is my favorite fighter." He grinned, then added, "There's a
  </p>
  <p>
   difference." Habermas -bearded, straight-talking, rough-hewn-is
  </p>
  <p>
   also a
  </p>
  <p>
   fighter, an academic pit bull who looks more like a nightclub
  </p>
  <p>
   bouncer than an ivory tower intellectual. Armed with razor-sharp
  </p>
  <p>
   arguments and historical evidence to back them up, he's not
  </p>
  <p>
   afraid to come out swinging.
  </p>
  <p>
   Antony Flew, one of the leading philosophical atheists in the
  </p>
  <p>
   world, found that out when he tangled with Habermas in a major
  </p>
  <p>
   debate on the topic "Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?" The results
  </p>
  <p>
   were decidedly one-sided. Of the five independent philosophers
  </p>
  <p>
   from various  colleges and universities who served as judges of
  </p>
  <p>
   the debates content, four concluded that Habermas had won. One
  </p>
  <p>
   called the contest  adraw. None cast a ballot for Flew. Commented
  </p>
  <p>
   one judge, "I was surprised (shocked might be a more accurate
  </p>
  <p>
   word) to see how weak Flew's own approach was.... I was left with
  </p>
  <p>
   this conclusion: Since the case against the resurrection was no
  </p>
  <p>
   stronger than that presented by Antony Flew, I would think it was
  </p>
  <p>
   time I began to take the resurrection  seriously."
  </p>
  <p>
   One of five other professional debate judges who evaluated the
  </p>
  <p>
   contestants'  argumentation techniques (again Habermas was the
  </p>
  <p>
   victor)
  </p>
  <p>
   felt compelled to write, "I conclude that the historical
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence, though flawed, is strong enough to lead reasonable
  </p>
  <p>
   minds to conclude that Christ did indeed rise from the dead....
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas does end up providing  'highly probable evidence' for
  </p>
  <p>
   the historicity of the resurrection 'with no plausible
  </p>
  <p>
   naturalistic evidence against it. Habermas, therefore, in my
  </p>
  <p>
   opinion, wins the debate." After earning a doctorate from
  </p>
  <p>
   Michigan State University, where he wrote his dissertation on the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection, Habermas received a doctor of divinity degree from
  </p>
  <p>
   Emmanuel College in Oxford, England. He has authored seven books
  </p>
  <p>
   dealing with Jesus rising from the dead, including The
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection of Jesus: A Rational Inquiry, The Resurrection  of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus: An Apologetic; The Historical Jesus; and Did Jesus Rise
  </p>
  <p>
   from the Dead? The Resurrection Debate, which was based on his
  </p>
  <p>
   debate with Flew. Among his other books are Dealing with Doubt
  </p>
  <p>
   and (with J. P. Moreland) Beyond Death: Exploring the Evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   for Immortality.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, he coedited In Defense ofMiracles and contributed to
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus under Fire and Living Your Faith: Closing the Gap between
  </p>
  <p>
   Mind and Heart. His one hundred articles have appeared in popular
  </p>
  <p>
   publications  (such as the Saturday Evening Post), scholarly
  </p>
  <p>
   journals
  </p>
  <p>
   (including Faith and Philosophy and Religious Studies), and
  </p>
  <p>
   reference  books (for example, The Baker Dictionary of Theology).
  </p>
  <p>
   He's also the former president of the Evangelical Philosophical
  </p>
  <p>
   Society. I don't mean to suggest by my earlier description that
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas is unnecessarily combative; he's friendly and self-
  </p>
  <p>
   effacing in casual conversations. I just wouldn't want to be on
  </p>
  <p>
   the other side of a hockey puck-or an argument-from him. He has
  </p>
  <p>
   an innate radar that helps him zero in on his opponent's
  </p>
  <p>
   vulnerable points. He also has a tender side, which I would
  </p>
  <p>
   discover-quite unexpectedly-before our interview  was over.
  </p>
  <p>
   I found Habermas in his no-nonsense office at Liberty University,
  </p>
  <p>
   where he is currently distinguished professor and chairman of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Department of Philosophy and Theology and director of the
  </p>
  <p>
   master's  program in apologetics. The room, with its black file
  </p>
  <p>
   cabinets, metal desk with simulated wood top, threadbare carpet,
  </p>
  <p>
   and folding guest chairs, is certainly no showplace. Like its
  </p>
  <p>
   occupant, it's free from pretension.
  </p>
  <h2>
   "DEAD PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT"
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Habermas, sitting behind his desk, rolled up the sleeves of his
  </p>
  <p>
   blue button-down shirt as I turned on my tape recorder and
  </p>
  <p>
   started our interview.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Isn't it true," I began with prosecutorial bluntness, "that
  </p>
  <p>
   there are absolutely no eyewitnesses to Jesus' resurrection?"
  </p>

   "That's exactly right-there's no descriptive account of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection,"  Habermas replied in an admission that might
  </p>
  <p>
   surprise
  </p>
  <p>
   people who only have a casual knowledge of the subject.
  </p>
  <p>
   "When I was young, I was reading a book by C. S. Lewis, who wrote
  </p>
  <p>
   that the New Testament says nothing about the Resurrection. I
  </p>
  <p>
   wrote a real big 'No!' in the margin. Then I realized what he was
  </p>
  <p>
   saying:  nobody was sitting inside the tomb and saw the body
  </p>
  <p>
   start to vibrate, stand up, take the linen wrappings off, fold
  </p>
  <p>
   them, roll back the stone, wow the guards, and leave.
  </p>
  <p>
   That, it seemed to me, might pose some problems. "Doesn't this
  </p>
  <p>
   hurt your efforts to establish that the Resurrection is a
  </p>
  <p>
   historical event?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas pushed back his chair to get more comfortable. "No, this
  </p>
  <p>
   doesn't hurt our case one iota, because science is all about
  </p>
  <p>
   causes and effects. We don't see dinosaurs; we study the fossils.
  </p>
  <p>
   We may not know how a disease originates, but we study its
  </p>
  <p>
   symptoms. Maybe nobody witnesses a crime, but police piece
  </p>
  <p>
   together the evidence after the fact.
  </p>
  <p>
   So," he continued, "here's how I look at the evidence for the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection: First, did Jesus die on the cross? And second, did
  </p>
  <p>
   he appear later to people? If you can establish those two things,
  </p>
  <p>
   you've made your case, because dead people don't normally do
  </p>
  <p>
   that." Historians agree there's plenty of evidence that Jesus was
  </p>
  <p>
   crucified,  and Dr. Alexander Metherell demonstrated in an
  </p>
  <p>
   earlier chapter  that Jesus could not have survived the rigors of
  </p>
  <p>
   that execution. That leaves the second part of the issue: did
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus really appear later? "What evidence is there that people
  </p>
  <p>
   saw him?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I'll start with evidence that virtually all critical scholars
  </p>
  <p>
   will admit," he said, opening the Bible in front of him. "Nobody
  </p>
  <p>
   questions that Paul wrote I Corinthians, and we have him
  </p>
  <p>
   affirming in two places that he personally encountered the
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrected Christ. He says in 1 Corinthians 9: 1, 'Am I not an
  </p>
  <p>
   apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?' And he says in 1
  </p>
  <p>
   Corinthians 15:8, 'Last of all he appeared to me also.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   I recognized that last quote as being attached to the early
  </p>
  <p>
   church creed that Craig Blomberg and I have already discussed. As
  </p>
  <p>
   William Lane Craig indicated, the first part of the creed (verses
  </p>
  <p>
   3-4) refers to Jesus' execution, burial, and resurrection.
  </p>
  <p>
   The final part of the creed (verses 5-8) deals with his post-
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection  appearances: "[Christ] appeared to Peter, and then
  </p>
  <p>
   to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the
  </p>
  <p>
   brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though
