  <p>
   though he had done no violence,
  </p>
  <p>
   nor was any deceit in his mouth....
  </p>
  <p>
   For he bore the sin of many,
  </p>
  <p>
   and made intercession for the transgressors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Isaiah 53:3-9, 12
  </p>
  <p>
   Instantly Lapides recognized the portrait: this was Jesus of
  </p>
  <p>
   Nazareth! Now he was beginning to understand the paintings he had
  </p>
  <p>
   seen in the Catholic churches he had passed as a child: the
  </p>
  <p>
   suffering Jesus, the crucified Jesus, the Jesus who he now
  </p>
  <p>
   realized had been "pierced for our transgressions" as he "bore
  </p>
  <p>
   the sin of many." As Jews in the Old Testament sought to atone
  </p>
  <p>
   for their sins through a system of animal sacrifices, here was
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, the ultimate sacrificial lamb of God, who paid for sin
  </p>
  <p>
   once and for all. Here was the personification of God's plan of
  </p>
  <p>
   redemption.
  </p>
  <p>
   So breathtaking was this discovery that Lapides could only come
  </p>
  <p>
   to one conclusion: it was a fraud! He believed that Christians
  </p>
  <p>
   had rewritten the Old Testament and twisted Isaiah's words to
  </p>
  <p>
   make it sound as if the prophet had been foreshadowing Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Lapides set out to expose the deception. "I asked my stepmother
  </p>
  <p>
   to send me a Jewish Bible so I could check it out myself," he
  </p>
  <p>
   told me. "She did, and guess what? I found that it said the same
  </p>
  <p>
   thing! Now I really had to deal with it."
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE JEWISHNESS OF JESUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Over and over Lapides would come upon prophecies in the Old
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament-more  than four dozen major predictions in all. Isaiah
  </p>
  <p>
   revealed the manner of the Messiah's birth (of a virgin); Micah
  </p>
  <p>
   pinpointed  the place of his birth (Bethlehem); Genesis and
  </p>
  <p>
   Jeremiah
  </p>
  <p>
   specified his ancestry (a descendent of Abraham, Isaac, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Jacob, from the tribe of Judah, the house of David); the Psalms
  </p>
  <p>
   foretold his betrayal, his accusation by false witnesses, his
  </p>
  <p>
   manner of death (pierced in the hands and feet, although
  </p>
  <p>
   crucifixion hadn't been invented yet), and his resurrection (he
  </p>
  <p>
   would not decay but would ascend on high); and on and on  .  Each
  </p>
  <p>
   one chipped away at Lapides' skepticism until he was finally
  </p>
  <p>
   willing to take a drastic step. "I decided to open the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament and just read the first page," he said. "With
  </p>
  <p>
   trepidation I slowly turned to Matthew as I looked up to heaven,
  </p>
  <p>
   waiting for the lightning bolt to strike!" Matthew's initial
  </p>
  <p>
   words leaped off the page: "A record of the genealogy of Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham ..." Lapides' eyes
  </p>
  <p>
   widened as he recalled the moment he first read that sentence. "I
  </p>
  <p>
   thought, Wow! Son of Abraham, son of David-it was all fitting
  </p>
  <p>
   together! I went to the birth narratives and thought, Look at
  </p>
  <p>
   this! Matthew is quoting from Isaiah 7:14: 'The virgin will be
  </p>
  <p>
   with child and will give birth to a son.' And then I saw him
  </p>
  <p>
   quoting from the prophet Jeremiah. I sat there thinking, You
  </p>
  <p>
   know, this is about Jewish people. Where do the Gentiles come in?
  </p>
  <p>
   What's going on here?
  </p>
  <p>
   "I couldn't put it down. I read through the rest of the gospels,
  </p>
  <p>
   and I realized this wasn't a handbook for the American Nazi
  </p>
  <p>
   Party; it was an interaction between Jesus and the Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   community. I got to the book of Acts and-this was incredible! -
  </p>
  <p>
   they were trying to figure out how the Jews could bring the story
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus to the Gentiles. Talk about role reversal!"
  </p>
  <p>
   So convincing were the fulfilled prophecies that Lapides started
  </p>
  <p>
   telling people that he thought Jesus was the Messiah. At the
  </p>
  <p>
   time, this was merely an intellectual possibility to him, yet its
  </p>
  <p>
   implications were deeply troubling.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I realized that if I were to accept Jesus into my life, there
  </p>
  <p>
   would have to be some significant changes in the way I was
  </p>
  <p>
   living," he explained. "I'd have to deal with the drugs, the sex,
  </p>
  <p>
   and so forth. I didn't understand that God would help me make
  </p>
  <p>
   those changes; I thought I had to clean up my life on my own."
  </p>
  <h2>
   EPIPHANY IN THE DESERT
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Lapides and some friends headed into the Mojave Desert for a
  </p>
  <p>
   getaway.  Spiritually he was feeling conflicted. He had been
  </p>
  <p>
   unsettled by nightmares of being torn apart by dogs pulling at
  </p>
  <p>
   him from opposite directions. Sitting among the desert scrub, he
  </p>
  <p>
   recalled the words someone had spoken to him on Sunset Strip:
  </p>
  <p>
   "You're either on God's side or on Satan's side."
  </p>
  <p>
   He believed in the embodiment of evil-and that's not whose
  </p>
  <p>
   side he wanted to be on. So Lapides prayed, "God, I've got to
  </p>
  <p>
   come to the end of this struggle. I have to know beyond a shadow
  </p>
  <p>
   of a doubt that Jesus is the Messiah. I need to know that you, as
  </p>
  <p>
   the God of Israel, want me to believe this."
  </p>
  <p>
   As he related the story to me, Lapides hesitated, unsure how to
  </p>
  <p>
   put into words what happened next. A few moments passed. Then he
  </p>
  <p>
   told me, "The best I can put together out of that experience is
  </p>
  <p>
   that God objectively spoke to my heart. He convinced me,
  </p>
  <p>
   experientially, that he exists. And at that point, out in the
  </p>
  <p>
   desert, in my heart I said, 'God, I accept Jesus into my life. I
  </p>
  <p>
   don't understand what I'm supposed  to do with him, but I want
  </p>
  <p>
   him. I've pretty much made a mess of my life; I need you to
  </p>
  <p>
   change me.'
  </p>
  <p>
   And God began to do that in a process that continues to this day.
  </p>
  <p>
   My friends knew my life had changed, and they couldn't understand
  </p>
  <p>
   it," he said. "They'd say, 'Something happened to you in the
  </p>
  <p>
   desert. You don't want to do drugs anymore. There's something
  </p>
  <p>
   different about you.'
  </p>
  <p>
   I would say, 'Well, I can't explain what happened. All I know is
  </p>
  <p>
   that there's someone in my life, and it's someone who's holy,
  </p>
  <p>
   who's righteous, who's a source of positive thoughts about life-
  </p>
  <p>
   and I just feel whole.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   That last word, it seemed, said everything. "Whole, " he
  </p>
  <p>
   emphasized  to me, "in a way I had never felt before."
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite the positive changes, he was concerned about breaking the
  </p>
  <p>
   news to his parents. When he finally did, reaction was mixed. "At
  </p>
  <p>
   first they were joyful because they could tell I was no longer
  </p>
  <p>
   dependent  on drugs and I sounded much better emotionally," he
  </p>
  <p>
   recalled. "But that began to unravel when they understood the
  </p>
  <p>
   source of all the changes. They winced, as if to say, 'Why does
  </p>
  <p>
   it have to be Jesus? Why can't it be something else?  They didn't
  </p>
  <p>
   know what to do with it." With a trace of sadness in his voice,
  </p>
  <p>
   he added, "I'm still not sure they really do."
  </p>
  <p>
   Through a remarkable string of circumstances, Lapides' prayer for
  </p>
  <p>
   a wife was answered when he met Deborah, who was also Jewish and
  </p>
  <p>
   a follower of Jesus. She took him to her church-the same one, it
  </p>
  <p>
   turned out, that was pastored by the minister who many months
  </p>
  <p>
   earlier  on Sunset Strip had challenged Lapides to read the Old
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament. Lapides laughed. "I'll tell you what-his jaw dropped
  </p>
  <p>
   open when he saw me walk into the church!"
  </p>
  <p>
   That congregation was filled with ex-bikers, ex-hippies, and ex-
  </p>
  <p>
   addicts  from the Strip, along with a spattering of transplanted
  </p>
  <p>
   Southerners.  For a young Jewish man from Newark who was
  </p>
  <p>
   relationally
  </p>
  <p>
   gun-shy with people who were different from him, because of the
  </p>
  <p>
   antiSemitism  he feared he would encounter, it was healing to
  </p>
  <p>
   learn to call such a diverse crowd "brothers and sisters."
  </p>
  <p>
   Lapides married Deborah a year after they met. Since then she has
  </p>
  <p>
   given birth to two sons. And together they've given birth to Beth
  </p>
  <p>
   Ariel Fellowship, a home for Jews and Gentiles who also are
  </p>
  <p>
   finding wholeness in Christ.
  </p>
  <h2>
   RESPONDING TO OBJECTIONS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Lapides finished his story and relaxed in his chair. I let the
  </p>
  <p>
   moment linger. The sanctuary was peaceful; the stained glass was
  </p>
  <p>
   glowing red and yellow and blue from the California sun. I sat
  </p>
  <p>
   musing over the power of one person's story of a faith found. I
  </p>
  <p>
   marveled at this saga of war and drugs, of Greenwich Village and
  </p>
  <p>
   Sunset Strip and a barren desert, none of which I ever would have
  </p>
  <p>
   associated with the pleasant, well-adjusted minister sitting in
  </p>
  <p>
   front of me.
  </p>
  <p>
   But I didn't want to ignore the obvious questions that his story
  </p>
  <p>
   raised. With Lapides' permission I started by asking the one that
  </p>
  <p>
   was foremost on my mind: "If the prophecies were so obvious to
  </p>
  <p>
   you and pointed so unquestionably toward Jesus, why don't more
  </p>
  <p>
   Jews accept him as their Messiah?"
  </p>
  <p>
   It was a question Lapides has asked himself a lot during the
  </p>
  <p>
   three decades since he was challenged by a Christian to
  </p>
  <p>
   investigate the Jewish Scriptures. "In my case, I took the time
  </p>
  <p>
   to read them," he replied. "Oddly enough, even though the Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   people are known for having high intellects, in this area there's
  </p>
  <p>
   a lot of ignorance. Plus you have countermissionary organizations
  </p>
  <p>
   that hold seminars in synagogues to try to disprove the messianic
  </p>
  <p>
   prophecies. Jewish people hear them and use them as an excuse for
  </p>
  <p>
   not exploring the prophecies personally. They'll say, 'The rabbi
  </p>
  <p>
   told me there's nothing to this.' I'll ask them, 'Do you think
  </p>
  <p>
   the rabbi just brought up an objection  that Christianity has
  </p>
  <p>
   never heard before? I mean, scholars have been working on this
  </p>
  <p>
   for hundreds of years! There's great literature out there and
  </p>
  <p>
   powerful Christian answers to those challenges.' If they're
  </p>
  <p>
   interested, I help them go further."
  </p>
  <p>
   I wondered about the ostracism a Jewish person faces if he or she
  </p>
  <p>
   becomes a Christian. "That's definitely a factor," he said. "Some
  </p>
  <p>
   people won't let the messianic prophecies grab them, because
  </p>
  <p>
   they're afraid of the repercussions-potential rejection by their
  </p>
  <p>
   family and the Jewish community. That's not easy to face. Believe
  </p>
  <p>
   me, I know." Even so, some of the challenges to the prophecies
  </p>
  <p>
   sound pretty convincing when a person first hears them. So one by
  </p>
  <p>
   one I posed the most common objections to Lapides to see how he
  </p>
  <p>
   would respond. 1. The Coincidence Argument
  </p>
  <p>
   First, I asked Lapides whether it's possible that Jesus merely
  </p>
  <p>
   fulfilled  the prophecies by accident. Maybe he's just one of
  </p>
  <p>
   many throughout  history who have coincidentally fit the
  </p>
  <p>
   prophetic fingerprint. "Not a chance," came his response. "The
  </p>
  <p>
   odds are so astronomical  that they rule that out. Someone did
  </p>
  <p>
   the math and figured out that the probability of just eight
  </p>
  <p>
   prophecies being fulfilled is one chance in one hundred million
  </p>
  <p>
   billion. That number is millions of times greater than the total
  </p>
  <p>
   number of people who've ever walked the planet! He calculated
  </p>
  <p>
   that if you took this number of silver dollars, they would cover
  </p>
  <p>
   the state of Texas to a depth of two feet. If you marked one
  </p>
  <p>
   silver dollar among them and then had a blindfolded person wander
  </p>
  <p>
   the whole state and bend down to pick up one coin, what would be
  </p>
  <p>
   the odds he'd choose the one that had been marked?"
  </p>
  <p>
   With that he answered his own question: "The same odds that
  </p>
  <p>
   anybody in history could have fulfilled just eight of the
  </p>
  <p>
   prophecies." I had studied this same statistical analysis by
  </p>
  <p>
   mathematician Peter W Stoner when I was investigating the
  </p>
  <p>
   messianic prophecies for myself. Stoner also computed that the
  </p>
  <p>
   probability of fulfilling forty-eight prophecies was one chance
  </p>
  <p>
   in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,
  </p>
  <p>
   trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,
  </p>
  <p>
   trillion ! Our minds can't comprehend a number that big. This is
  </p>
  <p>
   a staggering  statistic that's equal to the number of minuscule
  </p>
  <p>
   atoms in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, billion
  </p>
  <p>
   universes the size of our universe! "The odds alone say it would
  </p>
  <p>
   be impossible for anyone to fulfill the Old Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   prophecies," Lapides concluded. "Yet Jesus-and only Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   throughout all of history-managed to do it."
  </p>
  <p>
   The words of the apostle Peter popped into my head: "But the
  </p>
  <p>
   things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all the
  </p>
  <p>
   prophets, that His Christ should suffer, He has thus fulfilled"
  </p>
  <p>
   (Acts 3:18 NASB).
  </p>
  <p>
   2. The Altered Gospel Argument
  </p>
  <p>
   I painted another scenario for Lapides, asking, "Isn't it
  </p>
  <p>
   possible that the gospel writers fabricated details to make it
  </p>
  <p>
   appear that Jesus fulfilled the prophecies?
  </p>
  <p>
   "For example," I said, "the prophecies say the Messiah's bones
  </p>
  <p>
   would remain unbroken, so maybe John invented the story about the
  </p>
  <p>
   Romans breaking the legs of the two thieves being crucified with
