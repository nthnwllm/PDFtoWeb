  <p>
   pain you feel when you bang your elbow and hit your funny bone?
  </p>
  <p>
   That's actually another nerve, called the ulna nerve. It's
  </p>
  <p>
   extremely painful when you accidentally hit it.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, picture taking a pair of pliers and squeezing and crushing
  </p>
  <p>
   that nerve," he said, emphasizing the word squeezing as he
  </p>
  <p>
   twisted an imaginary pair of pliers. "That effect would be
  </p>
  <p>
   similar to what Jesus experienced."
  </p>
  <p>
   I winced at the image and squirmed in my chair.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The pain was absolutely unbearable," he continued. "In fact, it
  </p>
  <p>
   was literally beyond words to describe; they had to invent a new
  </p>
  <p>
   word: excruciating. Literally, excruciating means 'out of the
  </p>
  <p>
   cross.'  Think of that: they needed to create a new word, because
  </p>
  <p>
   there was nothing in the language that could describe the intense
  </p>
  <p>
   anguish caused during  the crucifixion.
  </p>
  <p>
   At this point Jesus was hoisted as the crossbar was attached to
  </p>
  <p>
   the vertical stake, and then nails were driven through Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   feet. Again, the nerves in his feet would have been crushed, and
  </p>
  <p>
   there would have been a similar type of pain."
  </p>
  <p>
   Crushed and severed nerves were certainly bad enough, but I
  </p>
  <p>
   needed to know about the effect that hanging from the cross would
  </p>
  <p>
   have had on Jesus. "What stresses would this have put on his
  </p>
  <p>
   body?" Metherell answered, "First of all, his arms would have
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately  been stretched, probably about six inches in length,
  </p>
  <p>
   and both shoulders would have become dislocated-you can determine
  </p>
  <p>
   this with simple mathematical equations.
  </p>
  <p>
   "This fulfilled the Old Testament prophecy in Psalm 22, which
  </p>
  <p>
   foretold the Crucifixion hundreds of years before it took place
  </p>
  <p>
   and says, 'My bones are out of joint."'
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE CAUSE OF DEATH
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Metherell had made his point-graphically-about the pain endured
  </p>
  <p>
   as the crucifixion process began. But I needed to get to what
  </p>
  <p>
   finally claims the life of a crucifixion victim, because that's
  </p>
  <p>
   the pivotal issue in determining whether death can be faked or
  </p>
  <p>
   eluded. So I put the cause-of-death question directly to
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Once a person is hanging in the vertical position," he replied,
  </p>
  <p>
   "crucifiction is essentially an agonizingly slow death by
  </p>
  <p>
   asphyxiation. The reason is that the stresses on the muscles and
  </p>
  <p>
   diaphragm Put the chest into the inhaled position; basically, in
  </p>
  <p>
   order to exhale, the individual must push up on his feet so the
  </p>
  <p>
   tension on the muscles  would be eased for a moment. In doing so,
  </p>
  <p>
   the nail would tear through the foot, eventually locking up
  </p>
  <p>
   against the tarsal bones. After managing to exhale, the person
  </p>
  <p>
   would then be able to relax down and take another breath in.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again he'd have to push himself up to exhale, scraping his
  </p>
  <p>
   bloodied back against the coarse wood of the cross. This would go
  </p>
  <p>
   on and on until complete exhaustion would take over, and the
  </p>
  <p>
   person wouldn't be able to push up and breathe anymore. As the
  </p>
  <p>
   person slows down his breathing, he goes into what is called
  </p>
  <p>
   respiratory acidosis-the carbon dioxide in the blood is dissolved
  </p>
  <p>
   as carbonic acid, causing the acidity of the blood to increase.
  </p>
  <p>
   This eventually  leads to an irregular heartbeat. In fact, with
  </p>
  <p>
   his heart beating erratically, Jesus would have known that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   at the moment of death, which is when he was able to say, 'Lord,
  </p>
  <p>
   into your hands I commit  my spirit.' And then he died of cardiac
  </p>
  <p>
   arrest."
  </p>
  <p>
   It was the clearest explanation I had ever heard of death by
  </p>
  <p>
   crucifixion-but  Metherell wasn't done.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Even before he died-and this is important, too-the hypovolemic
  </p>
  <p>
   shock would have caused a sustained rapid heart rate that
  </p>
  <p>
   would have contributed to heart failure, resulting in the
  </p>
  <p>
   collection of fluid in the membrane around the heart, called a
  </p>
  <p>
   pericardial effusion, as well as around the lungs, which is
  </p>
  <p>
   called a pleural effusion." "Why is that significant?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Because of what happened when the Roman soldier came
  </p>
  <p>
   around and, being fairly certain that Jesus was dead, confirmed
  </p>
  <p>
   it by thrusting a spear into his right side. It was probably his
  </p>
  <p>
   right side; that's not certain, but from the description it was
  </p>
  <p>
   probably the right side, between the ribs.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The spear apparently went through the right lung and into the
  </p>
  <p>
   heart, so when the spear was pulled out, some fluid-the
  </p>
  <p>
   pericardial effusion and the pleural effusion-came out. This
  </p>
  <p>
   would have the appearance of a clear fluid, like water, followed
  </p>
  <p>
   by a large volume of blood, as the eyewitness John described in
  </p>
  <p>
   his gospel."
  </p>
  <p>
   John probably had no idea why he saw both blood and a clear fluid
  </p>
  <p>
   come out-certainly that's not what an untrained person like him
  </p>
  <p>
   would have anticipated. Yet John's description is consistent with
  </p>
  <p>
   what modern medicine would expect to have happened. At first this
  </p>
  <p>
   would seem to give credibility to John being an eyewitness;
  </p>
  <p>
   however, there seemed to be one big flaw in all this.
  </p>
  <p>
   I pulled out my Bible and flipped to John 19:34. "Wait a minute,
  </p>
  <p>
   Doc," I protested. "When you carefully read what John said, he
  </p>
  <p>
   saw 'blood and water' come out; he intentionally put the words in
  </p>
  <p>
   that order. But according to you, the clear fluid would have come
  </p>
  <p>
   out first. So there's a significant discrepancy here."
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell smiled slightly. "I'm not a Greek scholar," he replied,
  </p>
  <p>
   "but according to people who are, the order of words in ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   Greek was determined not necessarily by sequence but by
  </p>
  <p>
   prominence. This means that since there was a lot more blood than
  </p>
  <p>
   water, it would have made sense for John to mention the blood
  </p>
  <p>
   first."
  </p>
  <p>
   I conceded the point but made a mental note to confirm it myself
  </p>
  <p>
   later. "At this juncture," I said, "what would Jesus' condition
  </p>
  <p>
   have been?" Metherell's gaze locked with mine. He replied with
  </p>
  <p>
   authority, "There was absolutely no doubt that Jesus was dead."
  </p>
  <h2>
   ANSWERING THE SKEPTICS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Dr. Metherell's assertion seemed well supported by the evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   But there were still some details I wanted to address-as well as
  </p>
  <p>
   at least one soft spot in his account that could very well
  </p>
  <p>
   undermine the credibility  of the biblical account.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The gospels say the soldiers broke the legs of the two criminals
  </p>
  <p>
   being crucified with Jesus," I said. "Why would they have done
  </p>
  <p>
   that?" "If they wanted to speed up death-and with the Sabbath and
  </p>
  <p>
   Passover coming, the Jewish leaders certainly wanted to get this
  </p>
  <p>
   over before sundown-the Romans would use the steel shaft of a
  </p>
  <p>
   short Roman spear to shatter the victim's lower leg bones. This
  </p>
  <p>
   would prevent  him from pushing up with his legs so he could
  </p>
  <p>
   breathe, and death by asphyxiation would result in a matter of
  </p>
  <p>
   minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of course, we're told in the New Testament that Jesus' legs were
  </p>
  <p>
   not broken, because the soldiers had already determined that he
  </p>
  <p>
   was dead, and they just used the spear to confirm it. This
  </p>
  <p>
   fulfilled another Old Testament prophecy about the Messiah, which
  </p>
  <p>
   is that his bones would remain unbroken."
  </p>
  <p>
   Again I jumped in. "Some people have tried to cast doubt on the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel accounts by attacking the Crucifixion story," I said. "For
  </p>
  <p>
   instance, an article in the Harvard Theological Review concluded
  </p>
  <p>
   many years ago that there was 'astonishing little evidence that
  </p>
  <p>
   the feet of a crucified person were ever pierced by nails.'
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead, the article said, 'the victim's hands and feet were tied
  </p>
  <p>
   to the cross by ropes.' Won't you concede that this raises
  </p>
  <p>
   credibility problems with the New Testament account?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Dr. Metherell. moved forward until he was sitting on the edge of
  </p>
  <p>
   his chair. "No," he said, "because archaeology has now
  </p>
  <p>
   established that the use of nails was historical-although I'll
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly concede that ropes were indeed sometimes used."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What's the evidence?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "In 1968 archaeologists in Jerusalem found the remains of about
  </p>
  <p>
   three dozen Jews who had died during the uprising against Rome
  </p>
  <p>
   around A.D. 70. One victim, whose name was apparently Yohanan,
  </p>
  <p>
   had been crucified. And sure enough, they found a seven-inch nail
  </p>
  <p>
   still driven into his feet, with small pieces of olive wood from
  </p>
  <p>
   the cross still attached. This was excellent archaeological
  </p>
  <p>
   confirmation of a key detail in the gospel's description of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Crucifixion."
  </p>
  <p>
   Touch', I thought. "But one other point of dispute concerns the
  </p>
  <p>
   expertise of the Romans to determine whether Jesus was dead," I
  </p>
  <p>
   pointed out. "These people were very primitive in terms of their
  </p>
  <p>
   understanding of medicine and anatomy and so forth-how do we know
  </p>
  <p>
   they weren't just mistaken when they declared that Jesus was no
  </p>
  <p>
   longer living?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "I'll grant you that these soldiers didn't go to medical school.
  </p>
  <p>
   But remember that they were experts in killing people-that was
  </p>
  <p>
   their job, and they did it very well. They knew without a doubt
  </p>
  <p>
   when a person  was dead, and really it's not so terribly
  </p>
  <p>
   difficult to figure out. "Besides, if a prisoner somehow escaped,
  </p>
  <p>
   the responsible soldiers  would be put to death themselves, so
  </p>
  <p>
   they had a huge incentive to make absolutely sure that each and
  </p>
  <p>
   every victim was dead when he was removed from the cross."
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE FINAL ARGUMENT
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Appealing to history and medicine, to archaeology and even Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   military rules, Metherell had closed every loophole: Jesus could
  </p>
  <p>
   not have come down from the cross alive. But still, I pushed him
  </p>
  <p>
   further. "Is there any possible way-anypossible way-that Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   could have survived this?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell shook his head and pointed his finger at me for
  </p>
  <p>
   emphasis.  "Absolutely not," he said. "Remember that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   already in hypovolemic shock from the massive blood loss even
  </p>
  <p>
   before the crucifixion  started. He couldn't possibly have faked
  </p>
  <p>
   his death, because                               you can't fake
  </p>
  <p>
   the inability to breathe for long. Besides, the spear thrust into
  </p>
  <p>
   his heart would have settled the issue once and for all. And the
  </p>
  <p>
   Romans weren't about to risk their own death by allowing him to
  </p>
  <p>
   walk away alive."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So," I said, "when someone suggests to you that Jesus merely
  </p>
  <p>
   swooned on the cross..."
  </p>
  <p>
   "I tell them it's impossible. It's a fanciful theory without any
  </p>
  <p>
   possible  basis in fact."
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet I wasn't quite ready to let go of the issue. At the risk of
  </p>
  <p>
   frustrating the doctor, I said, "Let's speculate that the
  </p>
  <p>
   impossible happened  and that Jesus somehow managed to survive
  </p>
  <p>
   the crucifixion. Let's say he was able to escape from his linen
  </p>
  <p>
   wrappings, roll the huge rock away from the mouth of his tomb,
  </p>
  <p>
   and get past the Roman soldiers  who were standing guard.
  </p>
  <p>
   Medically speaking, what condition would he have been in after he
  </p>
  <p>
   tracked down his disciples?" Metherell was reluctant to play that
  </p>
  <p>
   game. "Again," he stressed, becoming a bit more animated,
  </p>
  <p>
   "there's just no way he could have survived the cross.
  </p>
  <p>
   But if he had, how could he walk around after nails had been
  </p>
  <p>
   driven through his feet? How could he have appeared on the road
  </p>
  <p>
   to Emmaus just a short time later, strolling for long distances?
  </p>
  <p>
   How could he have used his arms after they were stretched and
  </p>
  <p>
   pulled from their joints? Remember, he also had massive wounds on
  </p>
  <p>
   his back and a spear wound to his chest."
  </p>
  <p>
   Then he paused. Something clicked in his mind, and now he was
  </p>
  <p>
   ready to make a closing point that would drive a final stake
  </p>
  <p>
   through the heart of the swoon theory once and for all. It was an
  </p>
  <p>
   argument that nobody has been able to refute ever since it was
  </p>
  <p>
   first advanced by German theologian David Strauss in 1835.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Listen," Metherell said, "a person in that kind of pathetic
  </p>
  <p>
   condition  would never have inspired his disciples to go out and
  </p>
  <p>
   proclaim that he's the Lord of life who had triumphed over the
  </p>
  <p>
   grave. "Do you see what I'm saying? After suffering that horrible
  </p>
  <p>
   abuse, with all the catastrophic blood loss and trauma, he would
  </p>
  <p>
   have looked so pitiful that the disciples would never have hailed
  </p>
  <p>
   him as a victorious  conqueror of death; they would have felt
  </p>
  <p>
   sorry for him and tried to nurse him back to health.
  </p>
  <p>
   So it's preposterous to think that if he had appeared to them in
  </p>
  <p>
   that awful state, his followers would have been prompted to start
  </p>
  <p>
   a worldwide movement based on the hope that someday they too
  </p>
  <p>
   would have a resurrection body like his. There's just no way."
