   probably completed it in about A.D. 93.
  </p>
  <p>
   "As you can imagine from his collaboration with the hated
  </p>
  <p>
   Romans, Josephus was extremely disliked by his fellow Jews. But
  </p>
  <p>
   he became very popular among Christians, because in his writings
  </p>
  <p>
   he refers to James, the brother of Jesus, and to Jesus himself."
  </p>
  <p>
   Here was our first example of corroboration for Jesus outside the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels. "Tell me about those references," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Replied Yamauchi, "In The Antiquities he describes how a high
  </p>
  <p>
   priest named Ananias took advantage of the death of the Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   governor  Festus-who is also mentioned in the New Testament-in
  </p>
  <p>
   order to have James killed."
  </p>
  <p>
   He leaned over to his bookshelf, pulled out a thick volume, and
  </p>
  <p>
   flipped to a page whose location he seemed to know by heart. "Ah,
  </p>
  <p>
   here it is," he said. "'He convened a meeting of the Sanhedrin
  </p>
  <p>
   and brought before them a man named James, the brother of Jesus,
  </p>
  <p>
   who was called the Christ, and certain others. He accused them of
  </p>
  <p>
   having transgressed the law and delivered them up to be stoned.'
  </p>
  <p>
   I know of no scholar," Yamauchi asserted confidently, "who has
  </p>
  <p>
   successfully disputed this passage. L. H. Feldman noted that if
  </p>
  <p>
   this had been a later Christian addition to the text, it would
  </p>
  <p>
   have likely been more laudatory of James. So here you have a
  </p>
  <p>
   reference to the brother of Jesus-who had apparently been
  </p>
  <p>
   converted by the appearance  of the risen Christ, if you compare
  </p>
  <p>
   John 7:5 and I Corinthians 15:7-and corroboration of the fact
  </p>
  <p>
   that some people considered Jesus to be the Christ, which means
  </p>
  <p>
   'the Anointed One' or'Messiah. THERE LIVED JESUS..."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I knew that Josephus had written an even lengthier section about
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, which is called the Testimonium Flavianum. I knew too that
  </p>
  <p>
   this passage was among the most hotly disputed in ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   literature because on its surface it appears to provide sweeping
  </p>
  <p>
   corroboration of jesus' life, miracles, death, and resurrection.
  </p>
  <p>
   But is it authentic? Or has it been doctored through the years by
  </p>
  <p>
   people favorable to Jesus? I asked Yamauchi for his opinion, and
  </p>
  <p>
   it was instantly clear I had tapped into an area of high interest
  </p>
  <p>
   for him. He uncrossed his legs and sat up straight in his chair.
  </p>
  <p>
   "This is a fascinating passage," he said with enthusiasm, leaning
  </p>
  <p>
   forward, book in hand. "But yes, it is controversial." With that
  </p>
  <p>
   he read it to me.
  </p>
  <p>
   About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one
  </p>
  <p>
   ought to call him a man. For he was one who wrought surprising
  </p>
  <p>
   feats and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth
  </p>
  <p>
   gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He
  </p>
  <p>
   was the Christ. When Pilate, upon hearing him accused by
  </p>
  <p>
   men of the highest standing among us, had condemned him to
  </p>
  <p>
   be crucified, those who had in the first place come to love him
  </p>
  <p>
   did not give up their affection for him. On the third day he
  </p>
  <p>
   appeared to them restored to life, for the prophets of God had
  </p>
  <p>
   prophesied these and countless other marvelous things about him.
  </p>
  <p>
   And the tribe of Christians, so called after him, has still to
  </p>
  <p>
   this day not disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>
   The wealth of corroboration for Jesus was readily evident. "You
  </p>
  <p>
   agreed this was controversial-what have scholars concluded about
  </p>
  <p>
   this passage?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Scholarship has gone through three trends about it," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "For obvious reasons, the early Christians thought it was a
  </p>
  <p>
   wonderful  and thoroughly authentic attestation of Jesus and his
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection. They loved it. Then the entire passage was
  </p>
  <p>
   questioned by at least some scholars during the Enlightenment.
  </p>
  <p>
   But today there's a remarkable consensus among both Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   and Christian scholars that the passage as a whole is authentic,
  </p>
  <p>
   although there may be some interpolations."
  </p>
  <p>
   I raised an eyebrow. "Interpolations-would you define what you
  </p>
  <p>
   Mean by that?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "That means early Christian copyists inserted some phrases that a
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish writer like Josephus would not have written," Yamauchi
  </p>
  <p>
   said. He pointed to a sentence in the book. "For instance, the
  </p>
  <p>
   first line says, 'About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man.'
  </p>
  <p>
   That phrase is not normally used of Jesus by Christians, so it
  </p>
  <p>
   seems authentic for Josephus. But the next phrase says, 'if
  </p>
  <p>
   indeed one ought to call him a man.' This implies Jesus was more
  </p>
  <p>
   than human, which appears to be an interpolation."
  </p>
  <p>
   I nodded to let him know I was following him so far.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It goes on to say, 'For he was one who wrought surprising feats
  </p>
  <p>
   and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He
  </p>
  <p>
   won over many Jews and many of the Greeks.' That seems to be
  </p>
  <p>
   quite in accord with the vocabulary Josephus uses elsewhere, and
  </p>
  <p>
   it's generally  considered authentic.
  </p>
  <p>
   But then there's this unambiguous statement, 'He was the
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ.' That seems to be an interpolation-
  </p>
  <p>
   Because," I interrupted, "Josephus says in his reference to James
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus was 'called the Christ."
  </p>
  <p>
   "That's right," said Yamauchi. "It's unlikely josephus would have
  </p>
  <p>
   flatly said Jesus was the Messiah here, when elsewhere he merely
  </p>
  <p>
   said he was considered to be the Messiah by his followers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The next part of the passage-which talks about Jesus' trial and
  </p>
  <p>
   crucifixion and the fact that his followers still loved him-is
  </p>
  <p>
   unexceptional  and considered genuine. Then there's this phrase:
  </p>
  <p>
   'On the
  </p>
  <p>
   third day he appeared to them restored to life.'
  </p>
  <p>
   Again, this is a clear declaration of belief in the Resurrection,
  </p>
  <p>
   and thus it's unlikely that Josephus wrote it. So these three
  </p>
  <p>
   elements seem to have been interpolations."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What's the bottom line?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "That the passage in Josephus probably was originally written
  </p>
  <p>
   about Jesus, although without those three points I mentioned. But
  </p>
  <p>
   even so, Josephus corroborates important information about Jesus:
  </p>
  <p>
   that he was the martyred leader of the church in Jerusalem and
  </p>
  <p>
   that he was a wise teacher who had established a wide and lasting
  </p>
  <p>
   following,  despite the fact that he had been crucified under
  </p>
  <p>
   Pilate at the instigation of some of the Jewish leaders."
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE IMPORTANCE OF JOSEPHUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While these references did offer some important independent
  </p>
  <p>
   verification  about Jesus, I wondered why a historian like
  </p>
  <p>
   Josephus wouldn't have said more about such an important figure
  </p>
  <p>
   of the first century. I knew that some skeptics, like Boston
  </p>
  <p>
   University philosopher Michael Martin, have made this same
  </p>
  <p>
   critique.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   So I asked for Yamauchi's reaction to this statement by Martin,
  </p>
  <p>
   who doesn't believe Jesus ever lived: "If Jesus did exist, one
  </p>
  <p>
   would have expected Josephus ... to have said more about him....
  </p>
  <p>
   It is unexpected  that Josephus mentioned him ... in passing
  </p>
  <p>
   while mentioning other Messianic figures and John the Baptist in
  </p>
  <p>
   greater detail." Yamauchi's response seemed uncharacteristically
  </p>
  <p>
   strong. "From time to time some people have tried to deny the
  </p>
  <p>
   existence of Jesus, but this is really a lost cause," he said
  </p>
  <p>
   with a tone of exasperation.  "There is overwhelming evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus did exist, and these hypothetical  questions are
  </p>
  <p>
   really very vacuous and fallacious.
  </p>
  <p>
   But I'd answer by saying this: Josephus was interested in
  </p>
  <p>
   political  matters and the struggle against Rome, so for him John
  </p>
  <p>
   the Baptist  was more important because he seemed to pose a
  </p>
  <p>
   greater political threat than did Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   I jumped in. "Hold on a second. Aren't there some scholars who
  </p>
  <p>
   have portrayed Jesus as a Zealot or at least sympathetic to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Zealots?" I asked, referring to a first-century revolutionary
  </p>
  <p>
   group that opposed Rome politically.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi dismissed the objection with a wave of his hand. "That
  </p>
  <p>
   is a position the gospels themselves do not support," he replied,
  </p>
  <p>
   "because remember, Jesus didn't even object to paying taxes to
  </p>
  <p>
   the Romans. Therefore because Jesus and his followers didn't pose
  </p>
  <p>
   an immediate political threat, it's certainly understandable that
  </p>
  <p>
   Josephus  isn't more interested in this sect-even though in
  </p>
  <p>
   hindsight it turned out to be very important indeed."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So in your assessment, how significant are these two references
  </p>
  <p>
   by Josephus?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Highly significant," Yamauchi replied, "especially since his
  </p>
  <p>
   accounts of the Jewish War have proved to be very accurate; for
  </p>
  <p>
   example,  they've been corroborated through archaeological
  </p>
  <p>
   excavations at Masada as well as by historians like Tacitus. He's
  </p>
  <p>
   considered to be a pretty reliable historian, and his mentioning
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus is considered extremely important."
  </p>
  <p>
   "A MOST MISCHIEVOUS SUPERSTITION"
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Yamauchi had just mentioned the most important Roman historian of
  </p>
  <p>
   the first century, and I wanted to discuss what Tacitus had to
  </p>
  <p>
   say about Jesus and Christianity. "Could you spell out what he
  </p>
  <p>
   corroborates?"  I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi nodded. "Tacitus recorded what is probably the most
  </p>
  <p>
   important reference to Jesus outside the New Testament," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "In A.D. 115 he explicitly states that Nero persecuted the
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians as scapegoats to divert suspicion away from himself
  </p>
  <p>
   for the great fire that had devastated Rome in A.D. 64."
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi stood and walked over to a shelf, scanning it for a
  </p>
  <p>
   certain  book. "Ah yes, here it is," he said, withdrawing a thick
  </p>
  <p>
   volume and leafing through it until he found the right passage,
  </p>
  <p>
   which he then read to me.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures
  </p>
  <p>
   on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the
  </p>
  <p>
   populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered
  </p>
  <p>
   the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of
  </p>
  <p>
   one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous
  </p>
  <p>
   superstition, thus checked for the moment,
  </p>
  <p>
   again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil,
  </p>
  <p>
   but even in Rome.... Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all
  </p>
  <p>
   who pleaded guilty: then, upon their information, an
  </p>
  <p>
   immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of
  </p>
  <p>
   firing the city, as of hatred against mankind.
  </p>
  <p>
   I was already familiar with that passage, and I was wondering how
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi would respond to an observation by a leading scholar
  </p>
  <p>
   named J. N. D. Anderson. "He speculates that when Tacitus says
  </p>
  <p>
   this 'mischievous superstition' was 'checked for the moment' but
  </p>
  <p>
   later 'again broke out,' he was unconsciously bearing testimony
  </p>
  <p>
   to the belief of early Christians that Jesus had been crucified
  </p>
  <p>
   but then rose from the grave," I said. "Do you agree with him?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi thought for a moment. "This has certainly been the
  </p>
  <p>
   interpretation of some scholars," he replied, seeming to duck my
  </p>
  <p>
   request for his opinion. But then he made a crucial point:
  </p>
  <p>
   "Regardless  of whether the passage had this specifically in
  </p>
  <p>
   mind, it does provide  us with a very remarkable fact, which is
  </p>
  <p>
   this: crucifixion was the most abhorrent fate that anyone could
  </p>
  <p>
   undergo, and the fact that there was a movement based on a
  </p>
  <p>
   crucified man has to be explained. How can you explain the spread
  </p>
  <p>
   of a religion based on the worship  of a man who had suffered the
  </p>
  <p>
   most ignominious death possible? Of course, the Christian answer
  </p>
  <p>
   is that he was resurrected. Others have to come up with some
  </p>
  <p>
   alternative theory if they don't believe that. But none of the
  </p>
  <p>
   alternative views, to my mind, are very persuasive." I asked him
  </p>
  <p>
   to characterize the weight of Tacitus's writings concerning
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus. "This is an important testimony by an unsympathetic
  </p>
  <p>
   witness to the success and spread of Christianity, based on a
  </p>
  <p>
   historical figureJesus-who  was crucified under Pontius Pilate,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he said. "And it's
  </p>
  <p>
   significant that Tacitus reported that an 'immense multitude'
  </p>
  <p>
   held so strongly to their beliefs that they were willing to die
  </p>
  <p>
   rather than recant."

   I knew that another Roman, called Pliny the Younger, had also
  </p>
  <p>
   referred to Christianity in his writings. "He corroborated some
  </p>
  <p>
   important  matters, too, didn't he?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "That's right. He was the nephew of Pliny the Elder, the famous
  </p>
  <p>
   encyclopedist who died in the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79.
