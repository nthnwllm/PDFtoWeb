   ancient historians or geographers  mention Nazareth before the beginning of the fourth century.9  The name first appears in Jewish literature in a poem written about the seventh century A.D. This absence of evidence paints a suspicious picture. So I put the issue directly to McRay: "Is there any archaeological confirmation  that Nazareth was in existence during the first century?" This issue wasn't new to McRay. "Dr. James Strange of the University  of South Florida is an expert on this area, and he describes Nazareth as being a very small place, about sixty acres, with a maximum  population of about four hundred and eighty at the beginning of the first century," McRay replied. However, that was a conclusion; I wanted the evidence. "How does he know that?" I asked. Well, Strange notes that when Jerusalem fell in A.D. 70, priests were no longer needed in the temple because it had been destroyed, so they were sent out to various other locations, even up into Galilee. Archaeologists have found a list in Aramaic describing the twenty-four  'courses,' or families, of priests who were relocated, and one of them was registered as having been moved to Nazareth. That shows that this tiny village must have been there at the time." In addition, he said there have been archaeological digs that have uncovered first-century tombs in the vicinity of Nazareth, which would establish the village's limits because by Jewish law burials had to take place outside the town proper. Two tombs contained objects such as pottery lamps, glass vessels, and vases from the first, third, or fourth centuries. McRay picked up a copy of a book by renowned archaeologist Jack Finegan, published by Princeton University Press. He leafed through it, then read Finegan's analysis: "From the tombs ... it can be concluded that Nazareth was a strongly Jewish settlement in the Roman period." McRay looked up at me. "There has been discussion about the location of some sites from the first century, such as exactly where Jesus' tomb is situated, but among archaeologists there has never really been a big doubt about the location of Nazareth. The burden of proof ought to be on those who dispute its existence." That seemed reasonable. Even the usually skeptical Ian Wilson, citing pre-Christian remains found in 1955 under the Church of the Annunciation in present-day Nazareth, has managed to concede, "Such findings suggest that Nazareth may have existed in Jesus' time, but there is no doubt that it must have been a very small and insignificant  place. 1" So insignificant that Nathanael's musings in John 1:46 now make more sense: "Nazareth!" he said. "Can anything good come from there?'

  <h2>
   PUZZLE 3: SLAUGHTER AT BETHLEHEM
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The gospel of Matthew paints a grisly scene: Herod the Great, the king of Judea, feeling threatened by the birth of a baby who he feared would eventually seize his throne, dispatches his troops to murder all the children under the age of two in Bethlehem. Warned by an angel, however, Joseph escapes to Egypt with Mary and Jesus. Only after Herod dies do they return to settle in Nazareth, the entire episode having fulfilled three ancient prophecies about the Messiah. (See Matt. 2:13-23.) The problem: there is no independent confirmation that this mass murder ever took place. There's nothing in the writings of Josephus or other historians. There's no archaeological support. There are no records or documents. "Certainly an event of this magnitude would have been noticed by someone other than Matthew," I insisted. "With the complete absence of any historical or archaeological corroboration, isn't it logical  to conclude that this slaughter never occurred?" "I can see why you'd say that," McRay replied, "since today an event like that would probably be splashed all over CNN and the rest of the news media." I agreed. In fact, in 1997 and 1998 there was a steady stream ol news accounts about Muslim extremists repeatedly staging commando raids and slaying virtually entire villages, including women and children, in Algeria. The entire world was taking notice. "But," added McRay, "you have to put yourself back in the first century and keep a few things in mind. First, Bethlehem was probably  no bigger than Nazareth, so how many babies of that age would there be in a village of five hundred or six hundred people? Not thousands,  not hundreds, although certainly a few. "Second, Herod the Great was a bloodthirsty king: he killed members  of his own family; he executed lots of people who he thought might challenge him. So the fact that he killed some babies in Bethlehem is not going to captivate the attention of people in the Roman world. "And third, there was no television, no radio, no newspapers. It would have taken a long time for word of this to get out, especially from such a minor village way in the back hills of nowhere, and historians  had much bigger stories to write about." As a journalist, this was still hard to fathom. "This just wasn't much of a story?" I asked, a bit incredulous. "I don't think it was, at least not in those days," he said. "A madman  killing everybody who seems to he a potential threat to him - that  was business as usual for Herod. Later, of course, as Christianity  developed, this incident became more important, but I would have been surprised if this had made a big splash back then." Maybe so, but this was difficult to imagine for a journalist who was trained to sniff out news in a highly technological age of rapid and worldwide communications. At the same time, I had to acknowledge  that from what I knew of the bloody landscape of ancient Palestine,  McRay's explanation did seem reasonable. This left one other area I wanted to inquire about. And to me, it was the most fascinating of all.

  <h2>
   RIDDLE OF THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Admittedly, there is an allure to archaeology. Ancient tombs, cryptic  inscriptions etched in stone or scratched onto papyrus, bits of broken pottery, worn coins-they're tantalizing clues for an inveterate  investigator. But few vestiges of the past have generated as much intrigue as the Dead Sea Scrolls, hundreds of manuscripts dating  from 250 B.C. to A.D. 68 that were found in caves twenty miles east of Jerusalem in 1947. They apparently had been hidden by a strict sect of Jews called the Essenes before the Romans destroyed their settlement. Some bizarre claims have been made about the scrolls, including John Marco Allegro's absurd book in which he theorized that Christianity  emerged from a fertility cult in which adherents tripped out on hallucinogenic mushrooms!" In a more legitimate but nevertheless  much-questioned assertion, papyri expert Jose O'Callaghan said one Dead Sea fragment is part of the earliest manuscript ever found of the gospel of Mark, dating back to a mere seventeen to twenty years after Jesus was crucified. However, many scholars continue to be skeptical of his interpretation." In any event, no inquiry into the archaeology of the first century Would be complete without asking about the scrolls. "Do they tell us anything directly about Jesus?" I asked McRay.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Well, no, Jesus isn't specifically mentioned in any of the scrolls," he replied. "Primarily these documents give us insights into Jewish life and customs." Then he pulled out some papers and pointed to an article that was published in late 1997. "Although," he added, "there is a very interesting development involving a manuscript  called 4Q521 that could tell us something about who Jesus was claiming to be." That whet my appetite. "Tell me about it," I said with some urgency in my voice. MeRay unfolded the mystery. The gospel of Matthew describes how John the Baptist, imprisoned and wrestling with lingering doubts about Jesus' identity, sent his followers to ask Jesus this monumental  question: "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?" (Matt. 11:3). He was seeking a straight answer about whether Jesus really was the long-awaited Messiah. Through the centuries, Christians have wondered about Jesus' rather enigmatic answer. Instead of directly saying yes or no, Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor" (Matt. 11:4-5). Jesus' response was an allusion to Isaiah 61. But for some reason Jesus included the phrase "the dead are raised," which is conspicuously  absent from the Old Testament text. This is where 4Q521 comes in. This nonbiblical manuscript from the Dead Sea collection, written in Hebrew, dates back to thirty years before Jesus was born. It contains a version of Isaiah 61 that does include this missing phrase, "the dead are raised." "[Scroll scholar Craig] Evans has pointed out that this phrase in 4Q521 is unquestionably embedded in a messianic context," McRa) said. "It refers to the wonders that the Messiah will do when he comes and when heaven and earth will obey him. So when Jesus gave his response to John, he was not being ambiguous at all. John would have instantly recognized his words as a distinct claim that Jesus was the Messiah." McRay tossed me the article in which Evans was quoted as saying, "4Q521 makes it clear that [Jesus'] appeal to Isaiah 61 is indeed messianic. In essence, Jesus is telling John through his messenger that messianic things are happening. So that answers [Johns] question:  Yes, he is the one who is to come." I sat back in my chair. To me, Evans' discovery was a remarkable confirmation of Jesus' self-identity. It was staggering to me how modern archaeology  could finally unlock the significance of a statement in which Jesus boldly asserted nearly two thousand years ago that he was indeed the anointed one of God.

   "A REMARKABLY ACCURATE SOURCE BOOK" Archaeology's repeated affirmation of the New Testament's accuracy provides important corroboration for its reliability. This is in stark contrast with how archaeology has proved to be devastating for Mormonism.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Although Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon church, claimed that his Book ofMormon is "the most correct of any book upon the earth," archaeology has repeatedly failed to substantiate its claims about events that supposedly occurred long ago in the Americas. I remember writing to the Smithsonian Institute to inquire about whether there was any evidence supporting the claims of Mormonism, only to be told in unequivocal terms that its archaeologists see "no direct connection between the archaeology of the New World and the subject matter of the book." As authors John Ankerberg and John Weldon concluded in a book on the topic, "In other words, no Book of Mormon cities have ever been located, no Book ofMormon person, place, nation, or name has ever been found, no Book of Mormon artifacts, no Book of Mormon  scriptures, no Book of Mormon inscriptions ... nothing which demonstrates the Book of Mormon is anything other than myth or invention has ever been found  ." However, the story is totally different for the New Testament. McRay's conclusions have been echoed by many other scientists, including prominent Australian archaeologist Clifford Wilson, who wrote, "Those who know the facts now recognize that the New Testament  must be accepted as a remarkably accurate source book."
