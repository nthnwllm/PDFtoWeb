  <p>
   ancient historians or geographers  mention Nazareth before the
  </p>
  <p>
   beginning of the fourth century.9  The name first appears in
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish literature in a poem written about the seventh century
  </p>
  <p>
   A.D.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   This absence of evidence paints a suspicious picture. So I put
  </p>
  <p>
   the issue directly to McRay: "Is there any archaeological
  </p>
  <p>
   confirmation  that Nazareth was in existence during the first
  </p>
  <p>
   century?"
  </p>
  <p>
   This issue wasn't new to McRay. "Dr. James Strange of the
  </p>
  <p>
   University  of South Florida is an expert on this area, and he
  </p>
  <p>
   describes Nazareth as being a very small place, about sixty
  </p>
  <p>
   acres, with a maximum  population of about four hundred and
  </p>
  <p>
   eighty at the beginning of the first century," McRay replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, that was a conclusion; I wanted the evidence. "How does
  </p>
  <p>
   he know that?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Well, Strange notes that when Jerusalem fell in A.D. 70, priests
  </p>
  <p>
   were no longer needed in the temple because it had been
  </p>
  <p>
   destroyed, so they were sent out to various other locations, even
  </p>
  <p>
   up into Galilee. Archaeologists have found a list in Aramaic
  </p>
  <p>
   describing the twenty-four  'courses,' or families, of priests
  </p>
  <p>
   who were relocated, and one of them was registered as having been
  </p>
  <p>
   moved to Nazareth. That shows that this tiny village must have
  </p>
  <p>
   been there at the time."
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, he said there have been archaeological digs that
  </p>
  <p>
   have uncovered first-century tombs in the vicinity of Nazareth,
  </p>
  <p>
   which would establish the village's limits because by Jewish law
  </p>
  <p>
   burials had to take place outside the town proper. Two tombs
  </p>
  <p>
   contained objects such as pottery lamps, glass vessels, and vases
  </p>
  <p>
   from the first, third, or fourth centuries.
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay picked up a copy of a book by renowned archaeologist
  </p>
  <p>
   Jack Finegan, published by Princeton University Press. He leafed
  </p>
  <p>
   through it, then read Finegan's analysis: "From the tombs ... it
  </p>
  <p>
   can be concluded that Nazareth was a strongly Jewish settlement
  </p>
  <p>
   in the Roman period."
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay looked up at me. "There has been discussion about the
  </p>
  <p>
   location of some sites from the first century, such as exactly
  </p>
  <p>
   where Jesus' tomb is situated, but among archaeologists there has
  </p>
  <p>
   never really been a big doubt about the location of Nazareth. The
  </p>
  <p>
   burden of proof ought to be on those who dispute its existence."
  </p>
  <p>
   That seemed reasonable. Even the usually skeptical Ian Wilson,
  </p>
  <p>
   citing pre-Christian remains found in 1955 under the Church of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Annunciation in present-day Nazareth, has managed to concede,
  </p>
  <p>
   "Such findings suggest that Nazareth may have existed in Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   time, but there is no doubt that it must have been a very small
  </p>
  <p>
   and insignificant  place. 1"
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   So insignificant that Nathanael's musings in John 1:46 now make
  </p>
  <p>
   more sense: "Nazareth!" he said. "Can anything good come from
  </p>
  <p>
   there?'
  </p>
  <h2>
   PUZZLE 3: SLAUGHTER AT BETHLEHEM
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The gospel of Matthew paints a grisly scene: Herod the Great, the
  </p>
  <p>
   king of Judea, feeling threatened by the birth of a baby who he
  </p>
  <p>
   feared would eventually seize his throne, dispatches his troops
  </p>
  <p>
   to murder all the children under the age of two in Bethlehem.
  </p>
  <p>
   Warned by an angel, however, Joseph escapes to Egypt with Mary
  </p>
  <p>
   and Jesus. Only after Herod dies do they return to settle in
  </p>
  <p>
   Nazareth, the entire episode having fulfilled three ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   prophecies about the Messiah. (See Matt. 2:13-23.)
  </p>
  <p>
   The problem: there is no independent confirmation that this mass
  </p>
  <p>
   murder ever took place. There's nothing in the writings of
  </p>
  <p>
   Josephus or other historians. There's no archaeological support.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are no records or documents.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Certainly an event of this magnitude would have been noticed by
  </p>
  <p>
   someone other than Matthew," I insisted. "With the complete
  </p>
  <p>
   absence of any historical or archaeological corroboration, isn't
  </p>
  <p>
   it logical  to conclude that this slaughter never occurred?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "I can see why you'd say that," McRay replied, "since today an
  </p>
  <p>
   event like that would probably be splashed all over CNN and the
  </p>
  <p>
   rest of the news media."
  </p>
  <p>
   I agreed. In fact, in 1997 and 1998 there was a steady stream ol
  </p>
  <p>
   news accounts about Muslim extremists repeatedly staging commando
  </p>
  <p>
   raids and slaying virtually entire villages, including women and
  </p>
  <p>
   children, in Algeria. The entire world was taking notice. "But,"
  </p>
  <p>
   added McRay, "you have to put yourself back in the first century
  </p>
  <p>
   and keep a few things in mind. First, Bethlehem was probably  no
  </p>
  <p>
   bigger than Nazareth, so how many babies of that age would there
  </p>
  <p>
   be in a village of five hundred or six hundred people? Not
  </p>
  <p>
   thousands,  not hundreds, although certainly a few.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Second, Herod the Great was a bloodthirsty king: he killed
  </p>
  <p>
   members  of his own family; he executed lots of people who he
  </p>
  <p>
   thought might challenge him. So the fact that he killed some
  </p>
  <p>
   babies in Bethlehem is not going to captivate the attention of
  </p>
  <p>
   people in the Roman world. "And third, there was no television,
  </p>
  <p>
   no radio, no newspapers. It would have taken a long time for word
  </p>
  <p>
   of this to get out, especially from such a minor village way in
  </p>
  <p>
   the back hills of nowhere, and historians  had much bigger
  </p>
  <p>
   stories to write about."
  </p>
  <p>
   As a journalist, this was still hard to fathom. "This just wasn't
  </p>
  <p>
   much of a story?" I asked, a bit incredulous.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I don't think it was, at least not in those days," he said. "A
  </p>
  <p>
   madman  killing everybody who seems to he a potential threat to
  </p>
  <p>
   him - that  was business as usual for Herod. Later, of course, as
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity  developed, this incident became more important, but
  </p>
  <p>
   I would have been surprised if this had made a big splash back
  </p>
  <p>
   then."
  </p>
  <p>
   Maybe so, but this was difficult to imagine for a journalist who
  </p>
  <p>
   was trained to sniff out news in a highly technological age of
  </p>
  <p>
   rapid and worldwide communications. At the same time, I had to
  </p>
  <p>
   acknowledge  that from what I knew of the bloody landscape of
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient Palestine,  McRay's explanation did seem reasonable.
  </p>
  <p>
   This left one other area I wanted to inquire about. And to me, it
  </p>
  <p>
   was the most fascinating of all.
  </p>
  <h2>
   RIDDLE OF THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Admittedly, there is an allure to archaeology. Ancient tombs,
  </p>
  <p>
   cryptic  inscriptions etched in stone or scratched onto papyrus,
  </p>
  <p>
   bits of broken pottery, worn coins-they're tantalizing clues for
  </p>
  <p>
   an inveterate  investigator. But few vestiges of the past have
  </p>
  <p>
   generated as much intrigue as the Dead Sea Scrolls, hundreds of
  </p>
  <p>
   manuscripts dating  from 250 B.C. to A.D. 68 that were found in
  </p>
  <p>
   caves twenty miles east of Jerusalem in 1947. They apparently had
  </p>
  <p>
   been hidden by a strict sect of Jews called the Essenes before
  </p>
  <p>
   the Romans destroyed their settlement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some bizarre claims have been made about the scrolls, including
  </p>
  <p>
   John Marco Allegro's absurd book in which he theorized that
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity  emerged from a fertility cult in which adherents
  </p>
  <p>
   tripped out on hallucinogenic mushrooms!" In a more legitimate
  </p>
  <p>
   but nevertheless  much-questioned assertion, papyri expert Jose
  </p>
  <p>
   O'Callaghan said one Dead Sea fragment is part of the earliest
  </p>
  <p>
   manuscript ever found of the gospel of Mark, dating back to a
  </p>
  <p>
   mere seventeen to twenty years after Jesus was crucified.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, many scholars continue to be skeptical of his
  </p>
  <p>
   interpretation."
  </p>
  <p>
   In any event, no inquiry into the archaeology of the first
  </p>
  <p>
   century Would be complete without asking about the scrolls. "Do
  </p>
  <p>
   they tell us anything directly about Jesus?" I asked McRay.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Well, no, Jesus isn't specifically mentioned in any of the
  </p>
  <p>
   scrolls," he replied. "Primarily these documents give us insights
  </p>
  <p>
   into Jewish life and customs." Then he pulled out some papers and
  </p>
  <p>
   pointed to an article that was published in late 1997.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Although," he added, "there is a very interesting development
  </p>
  <p>
   involving a manuscript  called 4Q521 that could tell us something
  </p>
  <p>
   about who Jesus was claiming to be."
  </p>
  <p>
   That whet my appetite. "Tell me about it," I said with some
  </p>
  <p>
   urgency in my voice.
  </p>
  <p>
   MeRay unfolded the mystery. The gospel of Matthew describes how
  </p>
  <p>
   John the Baptist, imprisoned and wrestling with lingering doubts
  </p>
  <p>
   about Jesus' identity, sent his followers to ask Jesus this
  </p>
  <p>
   monumental  question: "Are you the one who was to come, or should
  </p>
  <p>
   we expect someone else?" (Matt. 11:3). He was seeking a straight
  </p>
  <p>
   answer about whether Jesus really was the long-awaited Messiah.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through the centuries, Christians have wondered about Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   rather enigmatic answer. Instead of directly saying yes or no,
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see:
  </p>
  <p>
   The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy
  </p>
  <p>
   are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news
  </p>
  <p>
   is preached to the poor" (Matt. 11:4-5).
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' response was an allusion to Isaiah 61. But for some reason
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus included the phrase "the dead are raised," which is
  </p>
  <p>
   conspicuously  absent from the Old Testament text.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is where 4Q521 comes in. This nonbiblical manuscript from
  </p>
  <p>
   the Dead Sea collection, written in Hebrew, dates back to thirty
  </p>
  <p>
   years before Jesus was born. It contains a version of Isaiah 61
  </p>
  <p>
   that does include this missing phrase, "the dead are raised."
  </p>
  <p>
   "[Scroll scholar Craig] Evans has pointed out that this phrase in

   4Q521 is unquestionably embedded in a messianic context," McRa)
  </p>
  <p>
   said. "It refers to the wonders that the Messiah will do when he
  </p>
  <p>
   comes and when heaven and earth will obey him. So when Jesus gave
  </p>
  <p>
   his response to John, he was not being ambiguous at all. John
  </p>
  <p>
   would have instantly recognized his words as a distinct claim
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus was the Messiah."
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay tossed me the article in which Evans was quoted as saying,
  </p>
  <p>
   "4Q521 makes it clear that [Jesus'] appeal to Isaiah 61 is indeed
  </p>
  <p>
   messianic. In essence, Jesus is telling John through his
  </p>
  <p>
   messenger that messianic things are happening. So that answers
  </p>
  <p>
   [Johns] question:  Yes, he is the one who is to come."
  </p>
  <p>
   I sat back in my chair. To me, Evans' discovery was a remarkable
  </p>
  <p>
   confirmation of Jesus' self-identity. It was staggering to me how
  </p>
  <p>
   modern archaeology  could finally unlock the significance of a
  </p>
  <p>
   statement
  </p>
  <p>
   in which Jesus boldly asserted nearly two thousand years ago that
  </p>
  <p>
   he was indeed the anointed one of God.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "A REMARKABLY ACCURATE SOURCE BOOK"
  </p>
  <p>
   Archaeology's repeated affirmation of the New Testament's
  </p>
  <p>
   accuracy provides important corroboration for its reliability.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is in stark contrast with how archaeology has proved to be
  </p>
  <p>
   devastating for Mormonism.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Although Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon church,
  </p>
  <p>
   claimed that his Book ofMormon is "the most correct of any book
  </p>
  <p>
   upon the earth," archaeology has repeatedly failed to
  </p>
  <p>
   substantiate its claims about events that supposedly occurred
  </p>
  <p>
   long ago in the Americas. I remember writing to the Smithsonian
  </p>
  <p>
   Institute to inquire about whether there was any evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   supporting the claims of Mormonism, only to be told in
  </p>
  <p>
   unequivocal terms that its archaeologists see "no direct
  </p>
  <p>
   connection between the archaeology of the New World and the
  </p>
  <p>
   subject matter of the book."
  </p>
  <p>
   As authors John Ankerberg and John Weldon concluded in a
  </p>
  <p>
   book on the topic, "In other words, no Book of Mormon cities have
  </p>
  <p>
   ever been located, no Book ofMormon person, place, nation, or
  </p>
  <p>
   name has ever been found, no Book of Mormon artifacts, no Book of
  </p>
  <p>
   Mormon  scriptures, no Book of Mormon inscriptions ... nothing
  </p>
  <p>
   which demonstrates the Book of Mormon is anything other than myth
  </p>
  <p>
   or invention has ever been found  ."
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the story is totally different for the New Testament.
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay's conclusions have been echoed by many other scientists,
  </p>
  <p>
   including prominent Australian archaeologist Clifford Wilson, who
  </p>
  <p>
   wrote, "Those who know the facts now recognize that the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament  must be accepted as a remarkably accurate source
  </p>
  <p>
   book."
