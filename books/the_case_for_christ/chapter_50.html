   Evidence?
  </p>
  <p>
   By November 8, 1981, my legend thesis, to which I had doggedly
  </p>
  <p>
   clung for so many years, had been thoroughly dismantled. What's
  </p>
  <p>
   more, my journalistic skepticism toward the supernatural had
  </p>
  <p>
   melted in light of the breathtaking historical evidence that the
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection of Jesus was a real, historical event. In fact, my
  </p>
  <p>
   mind could not conjure  up a single explanation that fit the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence of history nearly as well as the conclusion that Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   was who he claimed to be: the one and only Son of God.
  </p>
  <p>
   The atheism I had embraced for so long buckled under the weight
  </p>
  <p>
   of historical truth. It was a stunning and radical outcome,
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly not what I had anticipated when I embarked on this
  </p>
  <p>
   investigative process. But it was, in my opinion, a decision
  </p>
  <p>
   compelled by the facts. All of which led me to the "So what?"
  </p>
  <p>
   question. If this is true, what difference does it make? There
  </p>
  <p>
   were several obvious implications.   If Jesus is the Son of God,
  </p>
  <p>
   his teachings are more than just good ideas from a wise teacher;
  </p>
  <p>
   they are divine insights on which I can confidently build my
  </p>
  <p>
   life.
  </p>
  <p>
   If Jesus sets the standard for morality, I can now have an
  </p>
  <p>
   unwavering  foundation for my choices and decisions, rather than
  </p>
  <p>
   basing them on the ever-shifting sands of expediency and
  </p>
  <p>
   selfcenteredness.   If Jesus did rise from the dead, he's still
  </p>
  <p>
   alive today and available  for me to encounter on a personal
  </p>
  <p>
   basis.
  </p>
  <p>
   If Jesus conquered death, he can open the door of eternal life
  </p>
  <p>
   for me, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   If Jesus has divine power, he has the supernatural ability to
  </p>
  <p>
   guide me and help me and transform me as I follow him.
  </p>
  <p>
   If Jesus personally knows the pain of loss and suffering, he
  </p>
  <p>
   can comfort and encourage me in the midst of the turbulence that
  </p>
  <p>
   he himself warned is inevitable in a world corrupted by sin.   If
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus loves me as he says, he has my best interests at heart.
  </p>
  <p>
   That means I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by
  </p>
  <p>
   committing myself to him and his purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
   If Jesus is who he claims to be (and remember, no leader of any
  </p>
  <p>
   other major religion has even pretended to be God), as my Creator
  </p>
  <p>
   he rightfully deserves my allegiance, obedience, and worship.
  </p>
  <p>
   I remember writing out these implications on my legal pad and
  </p>
  <p>
   then leaning back in my chair. I had reached the culmination of
  </p>
  <p>
   my nearly two-year journey. It was finally time to deal with the
  </p>
  <p>
   most pressing question of all: "Now what?"
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE FORMULA OF FAITH
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   After a personal investigation that spanned more than six hundred
  </p>
  <p>
   days and countless hours, my own verdict in the case for Christ
  </p>
  <p>
   was clear. However, as I sat at my desk, I realized that I needed
  </p>
  <p>
   more than an intellectual decision. I wanted to take the
  </p>
  <p>
   experiential step that J. P. Moreland had described in the last
  </p>
  <p>
   interview.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking for a way to bring that about, I reached over to a Bible
  </p>
  <p>
   and opened it to John 1:12, a verse I had encountered during my
  </p>
  <p>
   investigation: "Yet to all who received him, to those who
  </p>
  <p>
   believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of
  </p>
  <p>
   God."
  </p>
  <p>
   The key verbs in that verse spell out with mathematical precision
  </p>
  <p>
   what it takes to go beyond mere mental assent to Jesus' deity and
  </p>
  <p>
   enter into an ongoing relationship with him by becoming adopted
  </p>
  <p>
   into God's family: believe + receive = become.
  </p>
  <h2>
   1. Believe
  </h2>
  <p>
   As someone educated in journalism and law, I was trained to
  </p>
  <p>
   respond to the facts, wherever they lead. For me, the data
  </p>
  <p>
   demonstrated convincingly that Jesus is the Son of God who died
  </p>
  <p>
   as my substitute  to pay the penalty I deserved for the
  </p>
  <p>
   wrongdoing I had committed.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   And there was plenty of wrongdoing. I'll spare myself the
  </p>
  <p>
   embarrassment  of going into details, but the truth is that I had
  </p>
  <p>
   been living a profane, drunken, self-absorbed, and immoral
  </p>
  <p>
   lifestyle. In my career, I had backstabbed my colleagues to gain
  </p>
  <p>
   a personal advantage  and had routinely violated legal and
  </p>
  <p>
   ethical standards in pursuit of stories. In my personal life, I
  </p>
  <p>
   was sacrificing my wife and children on the altar of success. I
  </p>
  <p>
   was a liar, a cheater, and a deceiver. My heart had shrunk to the
  </p>
  <p>
   point where it was rock hard toward anyone else. My main
  </p>
  <p>
   motivator was personal pleasure-and ironically,  the more I
  </p>
  <p>
   hungrily sought after it, the more elusive and selfdestructive
  </p>
  <p>
   it became.
  </p>
  <p>
   When I read in the Bible that these sins separated me from God,
  </p>
  <p>
   who is holy and morally pure, this resonated as being true.
  </p>
  <p>
   Certainly God, whose existence I had denied for years, seemed
  </p>
  <p>
   extremely distant,  and it became obvious to me that I needed the
  </p>
  <p>
   cross of Jesus to bridge that gulf. Said the apostle Peter, "For
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the
  </p>
  <p>
   unrighteous, to bring you to God" (1 Peter 3:18).
  </p>
  <p>
   All this I now believed. The evidence of history and of my own
  </p>
  <p>
   experience was too strong to ignore.
  </p>
  <h2>
   2. Receive
  </h2>
  <p>
   Every other faith system I studied during my investigation was
  </p>
  <p>
   based on the "do" plan. In other words, it was necessary for
  </p>
  <p>
   people to do something-for example, use a Tibetan prayer wheel,
  </p>
  <p>
   pay alms, go on pilgrimages, undergo reincarnations, work off
  </p>
  <p>
   karma from past misdeeds, reform their character-to try to
  </p>
  <p>
   somehow earn their way back to God. Despite their best efforts,
  </p>
  <p>
   lots of sincere people just wouldn't make it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity is unique. It's based on the "done" plan-Jesus has
  </p>
  <p>
   done for us on the cross what we cannot do for ourselves: he has
  </p>
  <p>
   paid the death penalty that we deserve for our rebellion and
  </p>
  <p>
   wrongdoing, so we can become reconciled with God.
  </p>
  <p>
   I didn't have to struggle and strive to try to do the impossible
  </p>
  <p>
   of making myself worthy. Over and over the Bible says that Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   offers forgiveness and eternal life as a free gift that cannot be
  </p>
  <p>
   earned (see Rom. 6:23; Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). It's called grace-
  </p>
  <p>
   amazing grace, unmerited favor. It's available to anyone who
  </p>
  <p>
   receives it in a sincere prayer of repentance. Even someone like
  </p>
  <p>
   me.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yes, I had to take a step of faith, as we do in every decision we
  </p>
  <p>
   make in life. But here's the crucial distinction: I was no longer
  </p>
  <p>
   trying to swim upstream against the strong current of evidence;
  </p>
  <p>
   instead I was choosing to go in the same direction that the
  </p>
  <p>
   torrent of facts was flowing. That was reasonable, that was
  </p>
  <p>
   rational, that was logical. What's more, in an inner and
  </p>
  <p>
   inexplicable way, it was also what I sensed God's Spirit was
  </p>
  <p>
   nudging me to do.
  </p>
  <p>
   So on November 8, 1981, I talked with God in a heartfelt and
  </p>
  <p>
   unedited prayer, admitting and turning from my wrongdoing, and
  </p>
  <p>
   receiving the gift of forgiveness and eternal life through Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
   I told him that with his help I wanted to follow him and his ways
  </p>
  <p>
   from here on out.
  </p>
  <p>
   There were no lightning bolts, no audible replies, no tingly
  </p>
  <p>
   sensations.  I know that some people feel a rush of emotion at
  </p>
  <p>
   such a
  </p>
  <p>
   moment; as for me, however, there was something else that was
  </p>
  <p>
   equally exhilarating: there was the rush of reason.
  </p>
  <p>
   Become
  </p>
  <p>
   After taking that step, I knew from John 1:12 that I had crossed
  </p>
  <p>
   the threshold into a new experience. I had become something
  </p>
  <p>
   different:  a child of God, forever adopted into his family
  </p>
  <p>
   through the historical,  risen Jesus. Said the apostle Paul,
  </p>
  <p>
   "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old
  </p>
  <p>
   has gone, the new has come" (2 Cor. 5:17).
  </p>
  <p>
   Sure enough, over time as I endeavored to follow Jesus' teachings
  </p>
  <p>
   and open myself to his transforming power, my priorities, my
  </p>
  <p>
   values,  and my character were (and continue to be) gradually
  </p>
  <p>
   changed. Increasingly I want Jesus' motives and perspective to be
  </p>
  <p>
   my own. To paraphrase Martin Luther King Jr., I may not yet be
  </p>
  <p>
   the man I should be or the man, with Christ's help, I someday
  </p>
  <p>
   will be-but thank God I'm not the man I used to be!
  </p>
  <p>
   Maybe that sounds mystical to you; I don't know. Not so long ago
  </p>
  <p>
   it would have to me. But it's very real to me now and to those
  </p>
  <p>
   around me. In fact, so radical was the difference in my life that
  </p>
  <p>
   a few months after I became a follower of Jesus, our five-year-
  </p>
  <p>
   old daughter Alison went up to my wife and said, "Mommy, I want
  </p>
  <p>
   God to do for me what he's done for Daddy."
  </p>
  <p>
   Here was a little girl who had only known a father who was
  </p>
  <p>
   profane,  angry, verbally harsh, and all too often absent. And
  </p>
  <p>
   even though she had never interviewed a scholar, never analyzed
  </p>
  <p>
   the data, never investigated historical evidence, she had seen up
  </p>
  <p>
   close the,influence that Jesus can have on one person's life. In
  </p>
  <p>
   effect, she was saying, "If this is what God does to a human
  </p>
  <p>
   being, that's what I want for me." Looking back nearly two
  </p>
  <p>
   decades, I can see with clarity that the day I personally made a
  </p>
  <p>
   decision in the case for Christ was nothing less than the pivotal
  </p>
  <p>
   event of my entire life.
  </p>
  <h2>
   REACHING YOUR OWN VERDICT
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Now to you. At the outset I encouraged you to approach the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence in this book as a fair and impartial juror as much as
  </p>
  <p>
   possible, drawing your conclusions based on the weight of the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence. In the end the verdict is yours and yours alone. Nobody
  </p>
  <p>
   else can cast the ballot for you. Perhaps after reading expert
  </p>
  <p>
   after expert, listening to argument after argument, seeing the
  </p>
  <p>
   answers to question after question, and testing the evidence with
  </p>
  <p>
   your logic and common sense, you've found, as I have, that the
  </p>
  <p>
   case for Christ is conclusive.
  </p>
  <p>
   The believe part of John 1:12 is firmly in place; all that's left
  </p>
  <p>
   is to receive Jesus' grace, and then you'll become his son or
  </p>
  <p>
   daughter, engaged in a spiritual adventure that can flourish for
  </p>
  <p>
   the rest of your life and into eternity. For you, the time for
  </p>
  <p>
   the experiential step has arrived, and I can't encourage you more
  </p>
  <p>
   strongly to take that step with enthusiasm.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, maybe questions still linger for you. Perhaps
  </p>
  <p>
   I didn't address the objection that's uppermost in your mind.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fair enough. No single book can deal with every nuance. However,
  </p>
  <p>
   I trust that the amount of information reported in these pages
  </p>
  <p>
   will at least have convinced you that it's reasonable-in fact,
  </p>
  <p>
   imperative-to continue  your investigation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Pinpoint where you think the evidence needs to be bolstered and
  </p>
  <p>
   then seek out additional answers from well-respected experts. If
  </p>
  <p>
   you believe you've come up with a scenario that better accounts
  </p>
  <p>
   for the facts, be willing to subject it to tough-minded scrutiny.
  </p>
  <p>
   Use the suggested  resources in this book to delve deeper. Study
  </p>
  <p>
   the Bible yourself  (one suggestion: The Journey, a special
  </p>
  <p>
   edition of the Bible thats designed for people who don't yet
  </p>
  <p>
   believe it's the word of God). Resolve that you'll reach a
  </p>
  <p>
   verdict when you've gathered a sufficient  amount of information,
  </p>
  <p>
   knowing that you'll never have full resolution  of every single
  </p>
  <p>
   issue. You may even want to whisper a prayer to the God who
  </p>
  <p>
   you're not sure exists, asking him to guide you to the truth
  </p>
  <p>
   about him. And through it all, you'll have my sincere
  </p>
  <p>
   encouragement  as you continue in your spiritual quest.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, I do feel a strong obligation to urge you to
  </p>
  <p>
   make this a front-burner issue in your life. Don't approach it
  </p>
  <p>
   casually or flippantly, because there's a lot riding on your
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusion. As Michael Murphy aptly put it, "We ourselves-and not
  </p>
  <p>
   merely the truth claims-are at stake in the investigation." In
  </p>
  <p>
   other words, if my conclusion  in the case for Christ is correct,
  </p>
  <p>
   your future and eternity hinge on how you respond to Christ. As
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus declared, "If you do not believe that I am the one I claim
  </p>
  <p>
   to be, you will indeed die in your sins" (John 8:24).
  </p>
  <p>
   Those are sober words, offered out of authentic and loving
  </p>
  <p>
   concern.  I cite them to underline the magnitude of this matter
  </p>
  <p>
   and in the hope that they will spur you to actively and
  </p>
  <p>
   thoroughly examine the case for Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the end, however, remember that some options just aren't
