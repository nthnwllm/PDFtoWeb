  <h2>
   A QUESTION FOR THE HEART
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Convincingly, masterfully, Metherell had established his case
  </p>
  <p>
   beyond a reasonable doubt. He had done it by focusing exclusively
  </p>
  <p>
   on the, "how" question: How was Jesus executed in a way that
  </p>
  <p>
   absolutely ensured his death? But as we ended, I sensed that
  </p>
  <p>
   something was missing. I had tapped into his knowledge, but I
  </p>
  <p>
   hadn't touched his heart. So as we stood to shake hands, I felt
  </p>
  <p>
   compelled to ask the why" question that begged to be posed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Alex, before I go, let me ask your opinion about something not
  </p>
  <p>
   your medical opinion, not your scientific evaluation, just
  </p>
  <p>
   something  from your heart."
  </p>
  <p>
   I felt him let down his guard a bit. "Yes," he said, "I'll try."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Jesus intentionally walked into the arms of his betrayer, he
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't resist arrest, he didn't defend himself at his trial-it
  </p>
  <p>
   was clear that he was willingly subjecting himself to what you've
  </p>
  <p>
   described as a humiliating and agonizing form of torture. And I'd
  </p>
  <p>
   like to know why. What could possibly have motivated a person to
  </p>
  <p>
   agree to endure this sort of punishment?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Alexander Metherell-the man this time, not the doctor searched
  </p>
  <p>
   for the right words.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Frankly, I don't think a typical person could have done it," he
  </p>
  <p>
   finally replied. "But Jesus knew what was coming, and he was
  </p>
  <p>
   willing  to go through it, because this was the only way he could
  </p>
  <p>
   redeem us-by serving as our substitute and paying the death
  </p>
  <p>
   penalty that we deserve because of our rebellion against God.
  </p>
  <p>
   That was his whole mission in coming to earth."
  </p>
  <p>
   Having said that, I could still sense that Metherell's
  </p>
  <p>
   relentlessly rational and logical and organized mind was
  </p>
  <p>
   continuing to crunch down my question to its most basic,
  </p>
  <p>
   nonreducible answer.
  </p>
  <p>
   "So when you ask what motivated him," he concluded, "well ... I
  </p>
  <p>
   suppose the answer can be summed up in one word-and that
  </p>
  <p>
   would be love."
  </p>
  <p>
   Driving away that night, it was this answer that played over and
  </p>
  <p>
   over in my mind.
  </p>
  <p>
   All in all, my trip to California had been thoroughly helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell had persuasively established that Jesus could not have
  </p>
  <p>
   survived  the ordeal of the cross, a form of cruelty so vile that
  </p>
  <p>
   the Romans exempted their own citizens from it, except for cases
  </p>
  <p>
   of high treason. Metherell's conclusions were consistent with the
  </p>
  <p>
   findings of other physicians who have carefully studied the
  </p>
  <p>
   issue. Among them is Dr. William D. Edwards, whose 1986 article
  </p>
  <p>
   in the Journal of the American  Medical Association concluded,
  </p>
  <p>
   "Clearly, the weight of the historical.  and medical evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   indicates that Jesus was dead before
  </p>
  <p>
   the wound to his side was inflicted.... Accordingly,
  </p>
  <p>
   interpretations based on the assumption that Jesus did not die on
  </p>
  <p>
   the cross appear to be at odds with modern medical knowledge."'
  </p>
  <p>
   Those who seek to explain away the resurrection of Jesus by
  </p>
  <p>
   claiming that he somehow escaped the clutches of death at
  </p>
  <p>
   Galgotha need to offer a more plausible theory that fits the
  </p>
  <p>
   facts.
  </p>
  <p>
   And then they too must end up pondering the haunting question
  </p>
  <p>
   that all of us need to consider: What could possibly have
  </p>
  <p>
   motivated Jesus to willingly allow himself to be degraded and
  </p>
  <p>
   brutalized the way that he did?
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <p>
   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  After considering Metherell's account, do you see any
  </p>
  <p>
   validity to the swoon theory? Why or why not?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  For two millennia the cross has been a symbol for Christians.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now that you've read Metherell's testimony, how might your own
  </p>
  <p>
   view of that symbol be different in the future?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.  Would you be willing to suffer for the sake of another
  </p>
  <p>
   person? For whom and why? What would it take to motivate you to
  </p>
  <p>
   endure torture  in the place of someone else?
  </p>
  <p>
   4.  How would you react to the soldiers if they were abusing,
  </p>
  <p>
   humiliating,  and torturing you, as they did Jesus? What could
  </p>
  <p>
   possibly
  </p>
  <p>
   account for Jesus' reaction, which was to utter in the midst of
  </p>
  <p>
   his agony, "Father, forgive them"?

   12: THE EVIDENCE OF THE MISSING BODY
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Was jesus' Body Really Absent from His Tomb?
  </p>
  <p>
   Candy heiress Helen Vorhees Brach flew into the world's busiest
  </p>
  <p>
   airport on a crisp autumn afternoon, stepped into a crowd, and
  </p>
  <p>
   promptly disappeared without a trace. For more than twenty years
  </p>
  <p>
   the mystery of what happened to this red-haired, animal-loving
  </p>
  <p>
   philanthropist  has baffled police and journalists alike.
  </p>
  <p>
   While investigators are convinced she was murdered, they
  </p>
  <p>
   haven't been able to determine the specific circumstances,
  </p>
  <p>
   largely because they've never found her body. Police have floated
  </p>
  <p>
   some speculation,  leaked tantalizing possibilities to the press,
  </p>
  <p>
   and even got a judge to declare that a con man was responsible
  </p>
  <p>
   for her disappearance.  But absent a corpse, her murder
  </p>
  <p>
   officially remains unsolved. Nobody has ever been charged with
  </p>
  <p>
   her slaying.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Brach case is one of those frustrating enigmas that keep me
  </p>
  <p>
   awake from time to time as I mentally sift through the sparse
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence and try to piece together what happened. Ultimately it's
  </p>
  <p>
   an unsatisfying  exercise; I want to know what happened, and
  </p>
  <p>
   there just aren't enough facts to chase away the conjecture.
  </p>
  <p>
   Occasionally bodies turn up missing in pulp fiction and real
  </p>
  <p>
   life, but rarely do you encounter an empty tomb. Unlike the case
  </p>
  <p>
   of Helen Brach, the issue with Jesus isn't that he was nowhere to
  </p>
  <p>
   be seen. It's that he was seen, alive; he was seen, dead; and he
  </p>
  <p>
   was seen, alive once more. If we believe the gospel accounts,
  </p>
  <p>
   this isn't a matter of a missing body. No, it's a matter of Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   still being alive, even to this day, even after publicly
  </p>
  <p>
   succumbing to the horrors of crucifixion so graphically depicted
  </p>
  <p>
   in the preceding chapter.
  </p>
  <p>
   The empty tomb, as an enduring symbol of the Resurrection, is the
  </p>
  <p>
   ultimate representation of Jesus' claim to being God. The apostle
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul said in I Corinthians 15:17 that the Resurrection is the
  </p>
  <p>
   very linchpin of the Christian faith: "If Christ has not been
  </p>
  <p>
   raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."
  </p>
  <p>
   Theologian Gerald O'Collins put it this way: "In a profound
  </p>
  <p>
   sense, Christianity without the resurrection is not simply
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity  without its final chapter. It is not Christianity
  </p>
  <p>
   at all." The Resurrection is the supreme vindication of Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   divine identity  and his inspired teaching. It's the proof of his
  </p>
  <p>
   triumph over sin and death. It's the foreshadowing of the
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection of his followers. It's the basis of Christian hope.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's the miracle of all miracles.
  </p>
  <p>
   If it's true. Skeptics claim that what happened to Jesus' body is
  </p>
  <p>
   still a mystery akin to Helen Brach's disappearance -there's not
  </p>
  <p>
   enough evidence, they say, to reach a firm conclusion.
  </p>
  <p>
   But others assert that the case is effectively closed, because
  </p>
  <p>
   there is conclusive proof that the tomb was vacant on that first
  </p>
  <p>
   Easter Morning.  And if you want someone to compellingly present
  </p>
  <p>
   that case, your best bet is to visit with William Lane Craig,
  </p>
  <p>
   widely considered to be among the world's foremost experts on the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection.

  <h2>
   THE ELEVENTH INTERVIEW- WILLIAM LANE CRAIG, PH.D.,
  </h2>
  <h2>
   D.TH.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I had an unusual perspective the first time I saw Bill Craig in
  </p>
  <p>
   action: I was seated behind him as he defended Christianity
  </p>
  <p>
   before a crowd of nearly eight thousand people, with countless
  </p>
  <p>
   others listening on more than one hundred radio stations across
  </p>
  <p>
   the country.
  </p>
  <p>
   As moderator of a debate between Craig and an atheist selected by
  </p>
  <p>
   the national spokesman for American Atheists, Inc., I marveled as
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig politely but powerfully built the case for Christianity
  </p>
  <p>
   while simultaneously dismantling the arguments for atheism. From
  </p>
  <p>
   where I was sitting, I could watch the faces of people as they
  </p>
  <p>
   discovered - many  for the first time-that Christianity can stand
  </p>
  <p>
   up to rational analysis and rugged scrutiny.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the end it was no contest. Among those who had entered the
  </p>
  <p>
   auditorium that evening as avowed atheists, agnostics, or
  </p>
  <p>
   skeptics, an overwhelming 82 percent walked out concluding that
  </p>
  <p>
   the case for Christianity had been the most compelling. Forty-
  </p>
  <p>
   seven people entered as nonbelievers and exited as Christians-
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig's arguments for the faith were that persuasive, especially
  </p>
  <p>
   compared with the paucity of evidence  for atheism. Incidentally,
  </p>
  <p>
   nobody became an atheist.
  </p>
  <p>
   So when I flew down to Atlanta to interview him for this book, I
  </p>
  <p>
   was anxious to see how he'd respond to the challenges concerning
  </p>
  <p>
   the empty tomb of Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
   He hadn't changed since I had seen him a few years earlier. With
  </p>
  <p>
   his close-cropped black beard, angular features, and riveting
  </p>
  <p>
   gaze, Craig still looks the role of a serious scholar. He speaks
  </p>
  <p>
   in cogent sentences, never losing his train of thought, always
  </p>
  <p>
   working through an answer methodically, point by point, fact by
  </p>
  <p>
   fact.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet he isn't a dry theologian. Craig has a refreshing enthusiasm
  </p>
  <p>
   for his work. His pale blue eyes dance as he weaves elaborate
  </p>
  <p>
   propositions  and theories; he punctuates his sentences with hand
  </p>
  <p>
   gestures that beckon for understanding and agreement; his voice
  </p>
  <p>
   modulates from near giddiness over some arcane theological point
  </p>
  <p>
   that he finds fascinating to hushed sincerity as he ponders why
  </p>
  <p>
   some scholars resist the evidence that he finds so compelling.
  </p>
  <p>
   In short, his mind is fully engaged, but so is his heart. When he
  </p>
  <p>
   talks about skeptics he has debated, it isn't with a smug or
  </p>
  <p>
   adversarial  tone. He goes out of his way to mention their
  </p>
  <p>
   endearing qualities when he can-this one was a wonderful speaker,
  </p>
  <p>
   that one was charming  over dinner.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the subtleties of our conversation, I sensed that he isnt out
  </p>
  <p>
   to pummel opponents with his arguments; he's sincerely seeking to
  </p>
  <p>
   win over people who he believes matter to God. He seems genuinely
  </p>
  <p>
   perplexed  why some people cannot, or will not, recognize the
  </p>
  <p>
   reality of the empty tomb.

   DEFENDING THE EMPTY TOMB
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Wearing blue jeans, white socks, and a dark-blue sweater with red
  </p>
  <p>
   turtleneck collar, Craig lounged on a floral couch in his living
  </p>
  <p>
   room. On the wall behind him was a large framed scene of Munich.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was there, fresh with a master of arts degree from Trinity
  </p>
  <p>
   Evangelical  Divinity School and a doctorate in philosophy from
  </p>
  <p>
   the University  of Birmingham, England, that Craig studied the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection for the first time, while earning another doctorate,
  </p>
  <p>
   this one in theology from the University of Munich. Later he
  </p>
  <p>
   taught at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and then served as
  </p>
  <p>
   a visiting scholar at the Higher Institute of Philosophy at the
  </p>
  <p>
   University of Louvain near Brussels. His books include Reasonable
  </p>
  <p>
   Faith; No Easy Answers; Knowing the Truth about the Resurrection;
  </p>
  <p>
   The Only Wise God, The Existence of God and the Beginning of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Universe; and (with Quentin Smith) Theism,  'Atheism, and Big
  </p>
  <p>
   Bang Cosmology, published by Oxford University  Press.
  </p>
  <p>
   He also contributed to The Intellectuals Speak Out about God;
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus under Fire, In Defense ofMiracles; and Does God Exist? In
  </p>
  <p>
   addition,  his scholarly articles have appeared in such journals
