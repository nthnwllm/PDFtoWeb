  <h2>
   A QUESTION FOR THE HEART
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Convincingly, masterfully, Metherell had established his case beyond a reasonable doubt. He had done it by focusing exclusively on the, "how" question: How was Jesus executed in a way that absolutely ensured his death? But as we ended, I sensed that something was missing. I had tapped into his knowledge, but I hadn't touched his heart. So as we stood to shake hands, I felt compelled to ask the why" question that begged to be posed. "Alex, before I go, let me ask your opinion about something not your medical opinion, not your scientific evaluation, just something  from your heart." I felt him let down his guard a bit. "Yes," he said, "I'll try." "Jesus intentionally walked into the arms of his betrayer, he didn't resist arrest, he didn't defend himself at his trial-it was clear that he was willingly subjecting himself to what you've described as a humiliating and agonizing form of torture. And I'd like to know why. What could possibly have motivated a person to agree to endure this sort of punishment?" Alexander Metherell-the man this time, not the doctor searched for the right words. "Frankly, I don't think a typical person could have done it," he finally replied. "But Jesus knew what was coming, and he was willing  to go through it, because this was the only way he could redeem us-by serving as our substitute and paying the death penalty that we deserve because of our rebellion against God. That was his whole mission in coming to earth." Having said that, I could still sense that Metherell's relentlessly rational and logical and organized mind was continuing to crunch down my question to its most basic, nonreducible answer. "So when you ask what motivated him," he concluded, "well ... I suppose the answer can be summed up in one word-and that would be love." Driving away that night, it was this answer that played over and over in my mind. All in all, my trip to California had been thoroughly helpful. Metherell had persuasively established that Jesus could not have survived  the ordeal of the cross, a form of cruelty so vile that the Romans exempted their own citizens from it, except for cases of high treason. Metherell's conclusions were consistent with the findings of other physicians who have carefully studied the issue. Among them is Dr. William D. Edwards, whose 1986 article in the Journal of the American  Medical Association concluded, "Clearly, the weight of the historical.  and medical evidence indicates that Jesus was dead before the wound to his side was inflicted.... Accordingly, interpretations based on the assumption that Jesus did not die on the cross appear to be at odds with modern medical knowledge."' Those who seek to explain away the resurrection of Jesus by claiming that he somehow escaped the clutches of death at Galgotha need to offer a more plausible theory that fits the facts. And then they too must end up pondering the haunting question that all of us need to consider: What could possibly have motivated Jesus to willingly allow himself to be degraded and brutalized the way that he did?
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations Questions for Reflection or Group Study 1.  After considering Metherell's account, do you see any validity to the swoon theory? Why or why not? 2.  For two millennia the cross has been a symbol for Christians. Now that you've read Metherell's testimony, how might your own view of that symbol be different in the future? 3.  Would you be willing to suffer for the sake of another person? For whom and why? What would it take to motivate you to endure torture  in the place of someone else? 4.  How would you react to the soldiers if they were abusing, humiliating,  and torturing you, as they did Jesus? What could possibly account for Jesus' reaction, which was to utter in the midst of his agony, "Father, forgive them"?

   12: THE EVIDENCE OF THE MISSING BODY
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Was jesus' Body Really Absent from His Tomb? Candy heiress Helen Vorhees Brach flew into the world's busiest airport on a crisp autumn afternoon, stepped into a crowd, and promptly disappeared without a trace. For more than twenty years the mystery of what happened to this red-haired, animal-loving philanthropist  has baffled police and journalists alike. While investigators are convinced she was murdered, they haven't been able to determine the specific circumstances, largely because they've never found her body. Police have floated some speculation,  leaked tantalizing possibilities to the press, and even got a judge to declare that a con man was responsible for her disappearance.  But absent a corpse, her murder officially remains unsolved. Nobody has ever been charged with her slaying. The Brach case is one of those frustrating enigmas that keep me awake from time to time as I mentally sift through the sparse evidence and try to piece together what happened. Ultimately it's an unsatisfying  exercise; I want to know what happened, and there just aren't enough facts to chase away the conjecture. Occasionally bodies turn up missing in pulp fiction and real life, but rarely do you encounter an empty tomb. Unlike the case of Helen Brach, the issue with Jesus isn't that he was nowhere to be seen. It's that he was seen, alive; he was seen, dead; and he was seen, alive once more. If we believe the gospel accounts, this isn't a matter of a missing body. No, it's a matter of Jesus still being alive, even to this day, even after publicly succumbing to the horrors of crucifixion so graphically depicted in the preceding chapter. The empty tomb, as an enduring symbol of the Resurrection, is the ultimate representation of Jesus' claim to being God. The apostle Paul said in I Corinthians 15:17 that the Resurrection is the very linchpin of the Christian faith: "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins." Theologian Gerald O'Collins put it this way: "In a profound sense, Christianity without the resurrection is not simply Christianity  without its final chapter. It is not Christianity at all." The Resurrection is the supreme vindication of Jesus' divine identity  and his inspired teaching. It's the proof of his triumph over sin and death. It's the foreshadowing of the resurrection of his followers. It's the basis of Christian hope. It's the miracle of all miracles. If it's true. Skeptics claim that what happened to Jesus' body is still a mystery akin to Helen Brach's disappearance -there's not enough evidence, they say, to reach a firm conclusion. But others assert that the case is effectively closed, because there is conclusive proof that the tomb was vacant on that first Easter Morning.  And if you want someone to compellingly present that case, your best bet is to visit with William Lane Craig, widely considered to be among the world's foremost experts on the Resurrection.

  <h2>
   THE ELEVENTH INTERVIEW- WILLIAM LANE CRAIG, PH.D.,
  </h2>
  <h2>
   D.TH.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I had an unusual perspective the first time I saw Bill Craig in action: I was seated behind him as he defended Christianity before a crowd of nearly eight thousand people, with countless others listening on more than one hundred radio stations across the country. As moderator of a debate between Craig and an atheist selected by the national spokesman for American Atheists, Inc., I marveled as Craig politely but powerfully built the case for Christianity while simultaneously dismantling the arguments for atheism. From where I was sitting, I could watch the faces of people as they discovered - many  for the first time-that Christianity can stand up to rational analysis and rugged scrutiny. In the end it was no contest. Among those who had entered the auditorium that evening as avowed atheists, agnostics, or skeptics, an overwhelming 82 percent walked out concluding that the case for Christianity had been the most compelling. Forty- seven people entered as nonbelievers and exited as Christians- Craig's arguments for the faith were that persuasive, especially compared with the paucity of evidence  for atheism. Incidentally, nobody became an atheist. So when I flew down to Atlanta to interview him for this book, I was anxious to see how he'd respond to the challenges concerning the empty tomb of Jesus. He hadn't changed since I had seen him a few years earlier. With his close-cropped black beard, angular features, and riveting gaze, Craig still looks the role of a serious scholar. He speaks in cogent sentences, never losing his train of thought, always working through an answer methodically, point by point, fact by fact. Yet he isn't a dry theologian. Craig has a refreshing enthusiasm for his work. His pale blue eyes dance as he weaves elaborate propositions  and theories; he punctuates his sentences with hand gestures that beckon for understanding and agreement; his voice modulates from near giddiness over some arcane theological point that he finds fascinating to hushed sincerity as he ponders why some scholars resist the evidence that he finds so compelling. In short, his mind is fully engaged, but so is his heart. When he talks about skeptics he has debated, it isn't with a smug or adversarial  tone. He goes out of his way to mention their endearing qualities when he can-this one was a wonderful speaker, that one was charming  over dinner. In the subtleties of our conversation, I sensed that he isnt out to pummel opponents with his arguments; he's sincerely seeking to win over people who he believes matter to God. He seems genuinely perplexed  why some people cannot, or will not, recognize the reality of the empty tomb.

   DEFENDING THE EMPTY TOMB
  </h2>

  <p>
   Wearing blue jeans, white socks, and a dark-blue sweater with red turtleneck collar, Craig lounged on a floral couch in his living room. On the wall behind him was a large framed scene of Munich. It was there, fresh with a master of arts degree from Trinity Evangelical  Divinity School and a doctorate in philosophy from the University  of Birmingham, England, that Craig studied the Resurrection for the first time, while earning another doctorate, this one in theology from the University of Munich. Later he taught at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and then served as a visiting scholar at the Higher Institute of Philosophy at the University of Louvain near Brussels. His books include Reasonable Faith; No Easy Answers; Knowing the Truth about the Resurrection; The Only Wise God, The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe; and (with Quentin Smith) Theism,  'Atheism, and Big Bang Cosmology, published by Oxford University  Press. He also contributed to The Intellectuals Speak Out about God; Jesus under Fire, In Defense ofMiracles; and Does God Exist? In addition,  his scholarly articles have appeared in such journals
