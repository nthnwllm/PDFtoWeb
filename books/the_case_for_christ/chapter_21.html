   With Craig Blomberg having established the essential reliability
  </p>
  <p>
   of the New Testament documents, Bruce Metzger having confirmed
  </p>
  <p>
   their accurate transmittal through history, Edwin Yarnauchi
  </p>
  <p>
   having demonstrated extensive corroboration by ancient historians
  </p>
  <p>
   and others, and now John McRay having shown how archaeology
  </p>
  <p>
   underscores their trustworthiness, I had to agree with Wilson.
  </p>
  <p>
   The case for Christ, while far from complete, was being
  </p>
  <p>
   constructed on solid bedrock. At the same time, I knew there were
  </p>
  <p>
   some high-profile professors who would dissent from that
  </p>
  <p>
   assessment. You've seen them quoted in Newsweek and being
  </p>
  <p>
   interviewed on the evening news, talking about their radical
  </p>
  <p>
   reassessment of Jesus. The time had come for me to confront
  </p>
  <p>
   their critiques head-on before I went any further in my
  </p>
  <p>
   investigation.  That meant a trip to Minnesota to interview a
  </p>
  <p>
   feisty,
  </p>
  <p>
   Yale-educated scholar named Dr. Gregory Boyd.

  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <p>
   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  What do you see as some of the shortcomings and benefits of
  </p>
  <p>
   using archaeology to corroborate the New Testament?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  If Luke and other New Testament writers are shown to be
  </p>
  <p>
   accurate in reporting incidental details, does this increase your
  </p>
  <p>
   confidence that they would be similarly careful in recording more
  </p>
  <p>
   important events? Why or why not?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.  Why do you find Dr. McRay's analysis of the puzzles
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning the census, the existence of Nazareth, and the
  </p>
  <p>
   slaughter at Bethlehem  to be generally plausible or implausible?
  </p>
  <p>
   4.  After having considered the eyewitness, documentary,
  </p>
  <p>
   corroborating,  and scientific evidence in the case for Christ,
  </p>
  <p>
   stop and assess your conclusions so far. On a scale of zero to
  </p>
  <p>
   ten, with zero being no confidence" in the essential reliability
  </p>
  <p>
   of the gospels and ten being "full confidence," where would you
  </p>
  <p>
   rate yourself at this point? What are some reasons you chose that
  </p>
  <p>
   number?

  <h2>
   6: THE REBUTTAL EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <p>
   is the Jesus of History the Same As the Jesus of Faith ?
  </p>
  <p>
   It happens all the time on Perry Mason reruns and in paperback
  </p>
  <p>
   novels, but it's extremely rare in real-life legal dramas. So
  </p>
  <p>
   when an eyewitness in a murder trial refused to point out the
  </p>
  <p>
   defendant as the slayer and instead confessed that he was the
  </p>
  <p>
   killer, the entire courtroom was stunned-and I had an amazing
  </p>
  <p>
   story for the Chicago Tribune. Richard Moss was accused of
  </p>
  <p>
   shooting a nineteen-year-old
  </p>
  <p>
   Chicagoan to death outside a northwest-side tavern. Moss's
  </p>
  <p>
   lifelong friend, Ed Passeri, was called to the witness stand to
  </p>
  <p>
   describe the altercation that led to the slaying.
  </p>
  <p>
   Passeri painted the scene that occurred outside the Rusty Nail
  </p>
  <p>
   Pub, and then the defense attorney asked him what happened to the
  </p>
  <p>
   victim. Without blinking, Passeri replied that after the victim
  </p>
  <p>
   stabbed him with a pair of scissors, "I shot him."
  </p>
  <p>
   The court transcriber's jaw dropped open. Prosecutors threw up
  </p>
  <p>
   their hands. The judge immediately halted the proceedings to
  </p>
  <p>
   advise Passeri of his constitutional right against self-
  </p>
  <p>
   incrimination. And then the defendant got on the stand to say
  </p>
  <p>
   yes, that's right-it was Passeri who committed the crime.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What Passeri did [by confessing] was an act of raw courage,
  </p>
  <p>
   crowed the defense attorney.
  </p>
  <p>
   But prosecutors were unconvinced. "What courage?" asked one of
  </p>
  <p>
   them. "Passeri knows he's not running the risk of prosecution,
  </p>
  <p>
   because the only evidence the state has points to Richard Moss!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Still overwhelmingly persuaded of Moss's guilt, prosecutors knew
  </p>
  <p>
   they had to present strong testimony to controvert Passeri's
  </p>
  <p>
   claim. In legal terminology, what they needed was "rebuttal
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence," defined  as any proof that's offered to "explain,
  </p>
  <p>
   counteract, or disprove" a witness's  account!
  </p>
  <p>
   The next day, prosecutors questioned three other eyewitnesses who
  </p>
  <p>
   said there was no doubt that it was Moss who had committed the
  </p>
  <p>
   slaying. Sure enough, based on this and other evidence, the
  </p>
  <p>
   jurors found Moss guilty.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prosecutors did the right thing. When the overpowering strength
  </p>
  <p>
   of the evidence clearly pointed toward the guilt of the
  </p>
  <p>
   defendant, they were wise to be skeptical of an essentially
  </p>
  <p>
   unsupported assertion made by someone with a vested interest in
  </p>
  <p>
   helping his friend. CAN THE JESUS SEMINAR BE REFUTED?
  </p>
  <p>
   How does this legal concept of rebuttal evidence fit into my
  </p>
  <p>
   investigation  of Jesus?
  </p>
  <p>
   Now that I had heard powerfully convincing and well-reasoned
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence from the scholars I questioned for this book, I needed
  </p>
  <p>
   to turn my attention to the decidedly contrary opinions of a
  </p>
  <p>
   small group of academics who have been the subject of a whirlwind
  </p>
  <p>
   of news coverage. I'm sure you've seen the articles. In recent
  </p>
  <p>
   years the news media have been saturated with uncritical reports
  </p>
  <p>
   about the Jesus Seminar, a self-selected group that represents a
  </p>
  <p>
   minuscule percentage of New Testament scholars but that generates
  </p>
  <p>
   coverage vastly out of proportion  to the group's influence.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Seminar's publicity-savvy participants attracted the press by
  </p>
  <p>
   voting with colored beads on whether they thought Jesus said what
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospels quote him as saying. A red bead meant Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   undoubtedly said this or something like it; a pink bead meant he
  </p>
  <p>
   probably said it; a gray bead meant he didn't say it but the
  </p>
  <p>
   ideas are similar to his own; and a black bead meant he didn't
  </p>
  <p>
   utter these words at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the end they concluded Jesus did not say 82 percent of what
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospels attribute to him. Most of the remaining 18 percent
  </p>
  <p>
   was considered somewhat doubtful, with only 2 percent of Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   sayings confidently determined to be authentic. Craving
  </p>
  <p>
   controversy and lacking the expertise to scrutinize the Seminar's
  </p>
  <p>
   methodology, journalists  devoted fountains of ink to the story.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then the Seminar published The Five Gospels, containing the four
  </p>
  <p>
   traditional gospels plus the questionable Gospel of Thomas, with
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' words color-coded to match the group's findings. Flip
  </p>
  <p>
   through it and You find expanses of black type but precious
  </p>
  <p>
   little in red. For example, the only words in the Lord's Prayer
  </p>
  <p>
   that the Seminar is convinced Jesus said are "Our Father."
  </p>
  <p>
   But I wanted to go beyond the headlines and to unearth, as
  </p>
  <p>
   commentator  Paul Harvey likes to say, "the rest of the story." I
  </p>
  <p>
   needed to know if there was any credible rebuttal evidence to
  </p>
  <p>
   refute these troubling  and widely publicized opinions. Were the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus Seminar's findings  solidly based on unbiased scholarly
  </p>
  <p>
   research, or were they like Passeri's ill-fated testimony: well
  </p>
  <p>
   meaning but ultimately unsupported? For answers, I made the six-
  </p>
  <p>
   hour drive to St. Paul, Minnesota, to confer with Dr. Gregory
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd, the Ivy League-educated theology professor  whose books and
  </p>
  <p>
   articles have challenged the Jesus Seminar head-on.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE FIFTH INTERVIEW: GREGORY A. BOYD, PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Boyd first clashed with the Jesus Seminar in 1996, when he wrote
  </p>
  <p>
   a devastating critique of liberal perspectives of Jesus, called
  </p>
  <p>
   Cynic Sage or Son of God? Recovering the Real Jesus in an Age of
  </p>
  <p>
   Revisionist  Replies. The heavily footnoted, 416-page tome was
  </p>
  <p>
   honored by readers of Christianity Today as one of their favorite
  </p>
  <p>
   books of the year. His popular paperback Jesus under Siege
  </p>
  <p>
   continues the same themes on a more introductory level.
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd's other books include the award-winning Letters from a
  </p>
  <p>
   Skeptic, in which he and his then-doubting father wrestle through
  </p>
  <p>
   tough issues involving Christianity (culminating in his father
  </p>
  <p>
   becoming  a committed Christian), and God at War: The Bible and
  </p>
  <p>
   Spiritual Conflict. In addition, he was a contributing scholar to
  </p>
  <p>
   The Quest Study Bible, which was designed for people who are
  </p>
  <p>
   asking intellectual questions about the Christian faith.
  </p>
  <p>
   After receiving a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the
  </p>
  <p>
   University  of Minnesota, Boyd earned a master of divinity degree
  </p>
  <p>
   (cum laude) from Yale University Divinity School and a doctorate
  </p>
  <p>
   (magna cum laude) from Princeton Theological Seminary.
  </p>
  <p>
   He is not, however, a stereotypical ivory tower intellectual.
  </p>
  <p>
   With wavy black hair, a wiry frame, and a wry smile, Boyd looks
  </p>
  <p>
   like the academic counterpart of comedian Howie Mandell. And like
  </p>
  <p>
   Mandell,  he is pure kinetic energy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Words gush from him like water from a ruptured pipe. He spins out
  </p>
  <p>
   sophisticated ideas and theological concepts at a dizzying rate.
  </p>
  <p>
   He fidgets, he gestures, he squirms in his chair. There's no time
  </p>
  <p>
   to tuck in his shirt all the way, to file the flurry of papers
  </p>
  <p>
   strewn about his office, or to shelve the books that sit in
  </p>
  <p>
   untidy stacks on his floor. He's too busy thinking, debating,
  </p>
  <p>
   questioning, wondering, dreaming, contemplating, inventing-and
  </p>
  <p>
   tackling one project after another. In fact, one career can't
  </p>
  <p>
   contain him. In addition to his position as professor of theology
  </p>
  <p>
   at Bethel College, he's also a pastor at Woodland Hills Church,
  </p>
  <p>
   where his passionate preaching has helped attendance grow from
  </p>
  <p>
   forty-two in 1992 to twenty-five hundred today. This real world
  </p>
  <p>
   environment helps anchor him in the reality of everyday life. For
  </p>
  <p>
   fun, he debates atheists. He grappled with the late Gordon Stein
  </p>
  <p>
   on the topic "Does God Exist?" He and pastor-turned-skeptic Dan
  </p>
  <p>
   Barker sparred over "Did Jesus Rise from the Dead?" And in a
  </p>
  <p>
   program sponsored by the Islamic Center of Minnesota, he
  </p>
  <p>
   challenged a Muslim on the issue "Is God a Trinity?" Boyd's agile
  </p>
  <p>
   mind, quick wit, empathy with people, and deep reservoir of
  </p>
  <p>
   biblical and philosophical  knowledge make him a formidable foe.
  </p>
  <p>
   What's more, he blends popular culture and serious scholarship as
  </p>
  <p>
   well as anyone I know. He knows football as well as footnotes. He
  </p>
  <p>
   can start a sentence with an offhand observation about a new
  </p>
  <p>
   movie and end it with a stratospheric reference to a profound
  </p>
  <p>
   philosophical conundrum. He's as comfortable reading Dilbert or
  </p>
  <p>
   watching Seinfeld as he is writing his impressive book Trinity
  </p>
  <p>
   and Process: A Critical Evaluation and Reconstruction of
  </p>
  <p>
   Hartshorne Di-Polar Theism towards a Trinitarian Metaphysics.
  </p>
  <p>
   His casual and colloquial style (what other biblical scholar gets
  </p>
  <p>
   away with words like "funky" and "wacko"?) quickly made me feel
  </p>
  <p>
   at home as we squeezed into his second-floor office. It was soon
  </p>
  <p>
   clear that Boyd was wound up and ready to go.

   WRITINGS FROM THE RADICAL FRINGE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I decided to start from the perspective of the average consumer
  </p>
  <p>
   of news. "People pick up a magazine or newspaper, read the
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusions of the Jesus Seminar, and assume that this represents
  </p>
  <p>
   the mainstream of New Testament scholarship," I said. "But is
  </p>
  <p>
   that really the case?" "No," he said, looking as if he had just
  </p>
  <p>
   bitten into something sour. "No, no, that's not the case. But
  </p>
  <p>
   you're right-people get that impression."
  </p>
  <p>
   He rocked in his chair until he got comfortable enough to tell a
  </p>
  <p>
   story. "When Time came out with its first major article on the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus Seminar," he said, "I happened to be in the process of
  </p>
  <p>
   talking about Christianity with a guy whom I was building a
  </p>
  <p>
   relationship with. He was very skeptical by nature and quite
  </p>
  <p>
   inebriated with New Age ideas. We had a mutual friend who was
  </p>
  <p>
   hospitalized, and when I went to visit him, this other guy was
  </p>
  <p>
   already there, reading Time. As I walked into the room, he said
