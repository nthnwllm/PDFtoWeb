  <p>
   picture of Jesus," he replied, speaking slowly as he chose each
  </p>
  <p>
   word with care.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Even so, you find Jesus making some very strong claims-for
  </p>
  <p>
   instance, that he was wisdom personified and that he was the one
  </p>
  <p>
   by whom God will judge all humanity, whether they confess him or
  </p>
  <p>
   disavow  him. A significant scholarly book has argued recently
  </p>
  <p>
   that if you isolate all the Q sayings, one actually gets the same
  </p>
  <p>
   kind of picture of Jesus-of someone who made audacious claims
  </p>
  <p>
   about himselfas  you find in the gospels more generally."
  </p>
  <p>
   I wanted to push him further on this point. "Would he be seen as
  </p>
  <p>
   a miracle worker?" I inquired.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Again," he replied, "you have to remember that you wouldn't get
  </p>
  <p>
   many miracle stories per se, because they're normally found in
  </p>
  <p>
   the narrative, and Q is primarily a list of sayings."
  </p>
  <p>
   He stopped to reach over to his desk, pick up a leather-bound
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible, and rustle through its well-worn pages.
  </p>
  <p>
   "But, for example, Luke 7:18-23 and Matthew 11:2-6 say that John
  </p>
  <p>
   the Baptist sent his messengers to ask Jesus if he really was the
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ, the Messiah they were waiting for. Jesus replied in
  </p>
  <p>
   essence, 'Tell him to consider my miracles. Tell him what you've
  </p>
  <p>
   seen: the blind see, the deaf hear, the lame walk, the poor have
  </p>
  <p>
   good news preached to them.'
  </p>
  <p>
   "So even in Q," he concluded, "there is clearly an awareness of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' ministry of miracles."
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg's mention of Matthew brought to mind another question
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning how the gospels were put together. "Why," I asked,
  </p>
  <p>
   "would Matthew-purported to be an eyewitness to Jesus-incorporate
  </p>
  <p>
   part of a gospel written by Mark, who everybody agrees was not an
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitness?  If Matthew's gospel was really written by an
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitness, you would think he would have relied on his own
  </p>
  <p>
   observations."
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg smiled. "It only makes sense if Mark was indeed basing
  </p>
  <p>
   his account on the recollections of the eyewitness Peter," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said. "As you've said yourself, Peter was among the inner circle
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus and was privy to seeing and hearing things that other
  </p>
  <p>
   disciples didn't. So it would make sense for Matthew, even though
  </p>
  <p>
   he was an eye witness,  to rely on Peter's version of events as
  </p>
  <p>
   transmitted through Mark." Yes, I thought to myself, that did
  </p>
  <p>
   make some sense. In fact, an analogy  began to form in my mind
  </p>
  <p>
   from my years as a newspaper reporter. I recalled being part of a
  </p>
  <p>
   crowd of journalists that once cornered the famous Chicago
  </p>
  <p>
   political patriarch, the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, to pepper
  </p>
  <p>
   him with questions about a scandal that was brewing in the police
  </p>
  <p>
   department. He made some remarks before escaping to his
  </p>
  <p>
   limousine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even though I was an eyewitness to what had taken place, I
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately went to a radio reporter who had been closer to
  </p>
  <p>
   Daley, and asked him to play back his tape of what Daley had just
  </p>
  <p>
   said. This way, I could make sure I had his words correctly
  </p>
  <p>
   written down. That, I mused, was apparently what Matthew did with
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark although  Matthew had his own recollections as a disciple,
  </p>
  <p>
   his quest for accuracy prompted him to rely on some material that
  </p>
  <p>
   came directly from Peter in Jesus' inner circle.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF JOHN
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Feeling satisfied with Blomberg's initial answers concerning the
  </p>
  <p>
   first three gospels-called the synoptics, which means "to view at
  </p>
  <p>
   the same time," because of their similar outline and
  </p>
  <p>
   interrelationship'-next I turned my attention to John's gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anyone who reads all four gospels will immediately recognize that
  </p>
  <p>
   there are obvious differences between the synoptics and the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel of John, and I wanted to know whether this means there are
  </p>
  <p>
   irreconcilable contradictions between them. "Could you clarify
  </p>
  <p>
   the differences between the synoptic gospels and John's gospel?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked Blomberg.
  </p>
  <p>
   His eyebrows shot up. "Huge question!" he exclaimed. "I hope to
  </p>
  <p>
   write a whole book on the topic."
  </p>
  <p>
   After I assured him I was only after the essentials of the issue,
  </p>
  <p>
   not an exhaustive discussion, he settled back into his chair.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, it's true that John is more different than similar to the
  </p>
  <p>
   synoptics,"  he began. "Only a handful of the major stories that
  </p>
  <p>
   appear in the other three gospels reappear in John, although that
  </p>
  <p>
   changes noticeably when one comes to Jesus' last week. From that
  </p>
  <p>
   point forward  the parallels are much closer.
  </p>
  <p>
   "There also seems to be a very different linguistic style. In
  </p>
  <p>
   John, Jesus uses different terminology, he speaks in long
  </p>
  <p>
   sermons, and there seems to be a higher Christology-that is, more
  </p>
  <p>
   direct and more blatant  claims that Jesus is one with the
  </p>
  <p>
   Father; God himself; the Way, the Truth, and the Life; the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection and the Life."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What accounts for the differences?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "For many years the assumption was that John knew everything
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew, Mark, and Luke wrote, and he saw no need to repeat it,
  </p>
  <p>
   so he consciously chose to supplement them. More recently it has
  </p>
  <p>
   been assumed that John is largely independent of the other three
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels, which could account for not only the different choices
  </p>
  <p>
   of material but also the different perspectives on Jesus."
  </p>
  <h2>
   JESUS' MOST AUDACIOUS CLAIM
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "There are some theological distinctives to John," I observed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "No question, but do they deserve to be called contradictions? I
  </p>
  <p>
   think the answer is no, and here's why: for almost every major
  </p>
  <p>
   theme or distinctive in John, you can find parallels in Matthew,
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark, and Luke, even if they're not as plentiful."
  </p>
  <p>
   That was a bold assertion. I promptly decided to put it to the
  </p>
  <p>
   test by raising perhaps the most significant issue of all
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning the differences between the synoptics and John's
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
   "John makes very explicit claims of Jesus being God, which some
  </p>
  <p>
   attribute to the fact that he wrote later than the others and
  </p>
  <p>
   began embellishing things," I said. "Can you find this theme of
  </p>
  <p>
   deity in the synoptics?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, I can," he said. "It's more implicit but you find it there.
  </p>
  <p>
   Think of the story of Jesus walking on the water, found in
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew 14:22-33 and Mark 6:45-52. Most English translations hide
  </p>
  <p>
   the Greek by quoting Jesus as saying, 'Fear not, it is I'
  </p>
  <p>
   Actually, the Greek literally says, 'Fear not, I am.' Those last
  </p>
  <p>
   two words are identical  to what Jesus said in John 8:58, when he
  </p>
  <p>
   took upon himself the divine name 'I AM,' which is the way God
  </p>
  <p>
   revealed himself to Moses in the burning bush in Exodus 3:14. So
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus is revealing himself as the one who has the same divine
  </p>
  <p>
   power over nature as Yahweh, the God of the Old Testament."
  </p>
  <p>
   I nodded. "That's one example," I said. "Do you have any others?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, I could go on along these lines," Blomberg said. "For
  </p>
  <p>
   instance, Jesus' most common title for himself in the first three
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels is 'Son of Man,' and-"
  </p>
  <p>
   I raised my hand to stop him. "Hold on," I said. Reaching into my
  </p>
  <p>
   briefcase, I pulled out a book and leafed through it until I
  </p>
  <p>
   located the quote I was looking for. "Karen Armstrong, the former
  </p>
  <p>
   nun who wrote the best-seller A History of God, said it seems
  </p>
  <p>
   that the term 'Son of Man' simply stressed the weakness and
  </p>
  <p>
   mortality of the human condition,' so by using it, Jesus was
  </p>
  <p>
   merely emphasizing that 'he was a frail human being who would one
  </p>
  <p>
   day suffer and die." If that's true," I said, "that doesn't sound
  </p>
  <p>
   like much of a claim to deity."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Blomberg's expression turned sour. "Look," he said firmly,
  </p>
  <p>
   "contrary  to popular belief, 'Son of Man' does not primarily
  </p>
  <p>
   refer to Jesus' humanity. Instead it's a direct allusion to
  </p>
  <p>
   Daniel 7:13-14." With that he opened the Old Testament and read
  </p>
  <p>
   those words of the prophet Daniel.
  </p>
  <p>
   In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like
  </p>
  <p>
   a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He
  </p>
  <p>
   approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He
  </p>
  <p>
   was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples,
  </p>
  <p>
   nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion  is
  </p>
  <p>
   an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom
  </p>
  <p>
   is one that will never be destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg shut the Bible. "So look at what Jesus is doing by
  </p>
  <p>
   applying the term 'Son of Man' to himself," he continued. "This
  </p>
  <p>
   is someone who approaches God himself in his heavenly throne room
  </p>
  <p>
   and is given universal authority and dominion. That makes 'Son of
  </p>
  <p>
   Man' a title of great exaltation, not of mere humanity."
  </p>
  <p>
   Later I came upon a comment by another scholar whom I would soon
  </p>
  <p>
   interview for this book, William Lane Craig, who has made a
  </p>
  <p>
   similar observation.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Son of Man" is often thought to indicate the humanity of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, just as the reflex expression "Son of God" indicates his
  </p>
  <p>
   divinity. In fact, just the opposite is true. The Son of Man was
  </p>
  <p>
   a divine figure in the Old Testament book of Daniel who would
  </p>
  <p>
   come at the end of the world to judge mankind and rule forever.
  </p>
  <p>
   Thus, the claim to be the Son of Man would be in effect
  </p>
  <p>
   a claim to divinity."
  </p>
  <p>
   Continued Blomberg: "In addition, Jesus claims to forgive sins in
  </p>
  <p>
   the synoptics, and that's something only God can do. Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   accepts prayer and worship. Jesus says, 'Whoever acknowledges me,
  </p>
  <p>
   I will acknowledge before my Father in heaven.' Final judgment is
  </p>
  <p>
   based on one's reaction to-whom? This mere human being? No, that
  </p>
  <p>
   would be a very arrogant claim. Final judgment is based on one's
  </p>
  <p>
   reaction to Jesus as God.
  </p>
  <p>
   "As you can see, there's all sorts of material in the synoptics
  </p>
  <p>
   about the deity of Christ, that then merely becomes more explicit
  </p>
  <p>
   in John's gospel."
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE GOSPELS' THEOLOGICAL AGENDA
  </h2>
  <p>
   In authoring the last gospel, John did have the advantage of
  </p>
  <p>
   being able to mull over theological issues for a longer period of
  </p>
  <p>
   time. So I asked Blomberg, "Doesn't the fact that John was
  </p>
  <p>
   writing with more of a theological bent mean that his historical
  </p>
  <p>
   material may have been tainted and therefore less reliable?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "I don't believe John is more theological," Blomberg stressed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "He just has a different cluster of theological emphases.
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew, Mark, and Luke each have very distinctive theological
  </p>
  <p>
   angles that they want to highlight: Luke, the theologian of the
  </p>
  <p>
   poor and of social concern; Matthew, the theologian trying to
  </p>
  <p>
   understand the relationship  of Christianity and Judaism; Mark,
  </p>
  <p>
   who shows Jesus as the suffering  servant. You can make a long
  </p>
  <p>
   list of the distinctive theologies of Matthew, Mark, and Luke."
  </p>
  <p>
   I interrupted because I was afraid Blomberg was missing my
  </p>
  <p>
   broader point. "OK, but don't those theological motivations cast
  </p>
  <p>
   doubt on their ability and willingness to accurately report what
  </p>
  <p>
   happened?" I asked. "Isn't it likely that their theological
  </p>
  <p>
   agenda would prompt them to color and twist the history they
  </p>
  <p>
   recorded?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "It certainly means that as with any ideological document, we
  </p>
  <p>
   have to consider that as a possibility," he admitted. "There are
  </p>
  <p>
   people with axes to grind who distort history to serve their
  </p>
  <p>
   ideological ends, but unfortunately people have concluded that
  </p>
  <p>
   always happens, which is a mistake.
  </p>
  <p>
   "In the ancient world the idea of writing dispassionate,
  </p>
  <p>
   objective  history merely to chronicle events, with no
  </p>
  <p>
   ideological purpose, was unheard of. Nobody wrote history if
  </p>
  <p>
   there wasn't a reason to learn from it."
  </p>
  <p>
   I smiled. "I suppose you could say that makes everything
  </p>
  <p>
   suspect,"  I suggested.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, at one level it does," he replied. "But if we can
  </p>
  <p>
   reconstruct reasonably accurate history from all kinds of other
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient sources, we ought to be able to do that from the gospels,
  </p>
  <p>
   even though they too are ideological."
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg thought for a moment, searching his mind for an
  </p>
  <p>
   appropriate  analogy to drive home his point. Finally he said,
  </p>
  <p>
   "Here's a modern  parallel, from the experience of the Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   community, that might clarify what I mean.  Some people, usually
  </p>
  <p>
   for anti-Semitic purposes, deny or downplay  the horrors of the
