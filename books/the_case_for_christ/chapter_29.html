   "Could Jesus' exorcisms really have been psychosomatic healings?"
  </p>
  <p>
   I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, in some cases, but again you have to look at the whole
  </p>
  <p>
   context.  What about the man who was possessed and Jesus sent the
  </p>
  <p>
   demons into the pigs and the pigs ran off the cliff? What's going
  </p>
  <p>
   on if that was a psychosomatic situation? I think Jesus really
  </p>
  <p>
   did drive out demons, and I think some people do that today.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same    time, we shouldn't be too quick to jump to a
  </p>
  <p>
   demonic conclusion when faced with a recalcitrant problem. As C.
  </p>
  <p>
   S. Lewis put it, there are two equal and opposite errors we can
  </p>
  <p>
   fall into concerning demons: 'One is to disbelieve in their
  </p>
  <p>
   existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and
  </p>
  <p>
   unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased
  </p>
  <p>
   with both errors.'" "You know, Gary, that idea might fly with the
  </p>
  <p>
   American Association  of Christian Counselors, but would secular
  </p>
  <p>
   psychologists consider  it rational to believe in the demonic?" I
  </p>
  <p>
   asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   I thought Collins might take offense at the question, which came
  </p>
  <p>
   out sounding more condescending than I had intended, but he
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't. "It's interesting how things are changing," he mused.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Our society   today is caught up in 'spirituality.' That's a
  </p>
  <p>
   term that can mean almost anything, but it does recognize the
  </p>
  <p>
   supernatural. It's very interesting  what psychologists are
  </p>
  <p>
   believing in these days. Some are into Eastern mystical stuff;
  </p>
  <p>
   some talk about the power of shamans to influence  people's
  </p>
  <p>
   lives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whereas twenty-five years ago the suggestion of demonic activity
  </p>
  <p>
   would have been immediately dismissed, many psychologists are
  </p>
  <p>
   beginning to recognize that maybe there are more things in heaven
  </p>
  <p>
   and earth than our philosophies can account for."
  </p>
  <h2>
   "PREPOSTEROUS IMAGINATION!"
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Collins and I had drifted a bit from the original point of our
  </p>
  <p>
   interview. As I thought about our talk while I was driving home,
  </p>
  <p>
   I returned to the central issue that had brought me to him: Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   claimed to be God. Nobody is suggesting he was intentionally
  </p>
  <p>
   deceptive. And now Collins has concluded, based on thirty-five
  </p>
  <p>
   years of psychological experience,  that he was not mentally
  </p>
  <p>
   impaired.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, that left me with a new question: Did Jesus fulfill the
  </p>
  <p>
   attributes of God? After all, it's one thing to claim divinity;
  </p>
  <p>
   it's quite another to embody the characteristics that make God,
  </p>
  <p>
   God.
  </p>
  <p>
   At a stoplight, I pulled a notebook out of my briefcase and
  </p>
  <p>
   scrawled a note to myself. Track down D. A. Carson. I knew that
  </p>
  <p>
   I'd want to talk to one of the country's leading theologians
  </p>
  <p>
   about this next matter. In the meantime my talk with Gary Collins
  </p>
  <p>
   prompted me to spend time that night carefully rereading the
  </p>
  <p>
   discourses of Jesus. I could detect no sign of dementia,
  </p>
  <p>
   delusions, or paranoia. On the contrary, I was moved once more by
  </p>
  <p>
   his profound wisdom, his uncanny insights, his poetic eloquence,
  </p>
  <p>
   and his deep compassion. Historian Philip Schaff said it better
  </p>
  <p>
   than I can.
  </p>
  <p>
   Is such an intellect-clear as the sky, bracing as the mountain
  </p>
  <p>
   air, sharp and penetrating as a sword, thoroughly healthy and
  </p>
  <p>
   vigorous, always ready and always self-possessed-liable to a
  </p>
  <p>
   radical and most serious delusion concerning his own character
  </p>
  <p>
   and mission? Preposterous imagination!'
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <p>
   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.   What are some of the differences between a patient in a
  </p>
  <p>
   mental hospital claiming to be God and Jesus making the same
  </p>
  <p>
   assertion about himself?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.   Read Jesus' teaching called the Beatitudes in Matthew
  </p>
  <p>
   5:1-12. What observations can you make about his intellect,
  </p>
  <p>
   eloquence, compassion, insight into human nature, ability to
  </p>
  <p>
   teach profound truths, and overall psychological health?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.   Having read Collins' response to the theory that hypnosis
  </p>
  <p>
   can account for Jesus' miracles, do you believe this is a viable
  </p>
  <p>
   hypothesis?  Why or why not?

   9: THE PROFILE EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <p>
   Did jesus Fulfill the Attributes of God?
  </p>
  <p>
   Shortly after eight student nurses were murdered in a Chicago
  </p>
  <p>
   apartment, the trembling lone survivor huddled with a police
  </p>
  <p>
   sketch artist and described in detail the killer she had seen
  </p>
  <p>
   from her secret vantage point beneath a bed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quickly the drawing was flashed around the city-to police
  </p>
  <p>
   officers,  to hospitals, to transit stations, to the airport.
  </p>
  <p>
   Soon an emergency room physician called detectives to say he was
  </p>
  <p>
   treating a man who looked suspiciously like the flinty-eyed
  </p>
  <p>
   fugitive depicted in the sketch. That's how police arrested a
  </p>
  <p>
   drifter named Richard Speck, who was promptly convicted of the
  </p>
  <p>
   heinous slayings and ended up dying in prison thirty years later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ever since Scotland Yard first turned a witness's recollections
  </p>
  <p>
   into a sketch of a murder suspect in 1889, forensic artists have
  </p>
  <p>
   played an important role in law enforcement. Today more than
  </p>
  <p>
   three hundred  sketch artists work with U.S. police agencies, and
  </p>
  <p>
   an increasing number of departments are relying on a computerized
  </p>
  <p>
   system called EFIT (Electronic Facial Identification Technique).
  </p>
  <p>
   This recently developed technology was successfully used to solve
  </p>
  <p>
   a 1997 kidnapping that occurred at a shopping mall just a few
  </p>
  <p>
   miles from my suburban Chicago home. The victim provided details
  </p>
  <p>
   about the kidnapper's appearance to a technician, who used a
  </p>
  <p>
   computer  to create an electronic likeness of the offender by
  </p>
  <p>
   choosing from different styles of noses, mouths, hairlines, and
  </p>
  <p>
   so forth. Just moments after the drawing was faxed to police
  </p>
  <p>
   agencies throughout the area, an investigator in another suburb
  </p>
  <p>
   recognized the Picture as a dead-ringer for a criminal he had
  </p>
  <p>
   encountered earlier. Fortunately, this led to a quick arrest of
  </p>
  <p>
   the kidnapping suspect. Oddly enough, the concept of an artist's
  </p>
  <p>
   drawing can provide a rough analogy that can help us in our quest
  </p>
  <p>
   for the truth about Jesus.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Here's how: The Old Testament provides numerous details about God
  </p>
  <p>
   that sketch out in great specificity what he's like. For
  </p>
  <p>
   instance, God is described as omnipresent, or existing everywhere
  </p>
  <p>
   in the universe; as omniscient, or knowing everything that can be
  </p>
  <p>
   known throughout eternity; as omnipotent, or all-powerful; as
  </p>
  <p>
   eternal, or being both beyond time and the source of all time;
  </p>
  <p>
   and as immutable, or unchanging in his attributes. He's loving,
  </p>
  <p>
   he's holy, he's righteous, he's wise, he's just.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, Jesus claims to be God. But does he fulfill these
  </p>
  <p>
   characteristics  of deity? In other words, if we examine Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   carefully, does his likeness closely match the sketch of God that
  </p>
  <p>
   we find elsewhere in the Bible? If it doesn't, we can conclude
  </p>
  <p>
   that his claim to being God is false.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is an extremely complex and mind-stretching issue. For
  </p>
  <p>
   example, when Jesus was delivering the Sermon on the Mount on a
  </p>
  <p>
   hillside outside Capernaum, he wasn't simultaneously standing on
  </p>
  <p>
   Main Street of Jericho, so in what sense could he be called
  </p>
  <p>
   omnipresent? How can he be called omniscient if he readily admits
  </p>
  <p>
   in Mark 13:32 that he doesn't know everything about the future?
  </p>
  <p>
   If he's eternal, why does Colossians 1:15 call him "the firstborn
  </p>
  <p>
   over all creation"?
  </p>
  <p>
   On the surface these issues seem to suggest that Jesus doesn't
  </p>
  <p>
   resemble the sketch of God. Nevertheless, I've learned over the
  </p>
  <p>
   years that initial impressions can be deceiving. That's why I was
  </p>
  <p>
   glad I would be able to discuss these issues with Dr. D. A.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carson, the theologian  who has emerged in recent years as one of
  </p>
  <p>
   the most distinguished  thinkers in Christianity.

  <h2>
   THE EIGHTH INTERVIEW: DONALD A. CARSON, PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   D. A. Carson, a research professor of New Testament at Trinity
  </p>
  <p>
   Evangelical  Divinity School, has written or edited more than
  </p>
  <p>
   forty books, including The Sermon on the Mount; Exegetical
  </p>
  <p>
   Fallacies; The Gospel According to John; and his award-winning
  </p>
  <p>
   The Gagging of God. He can read a dozen languages (his mastery of
  </p>
  <p>
   French stems from a childhood spent in Quebec) and is a member of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Tyndale Fellowship  for Biblical Research, the Society for
  </p>
  <p>
   Biblical Literature, and the Institute for Biblical Research. His
  </p>
  <p>
   areas of expertise include the historical Jesus, postmodernism,
  </p>
  <p>
   Greek grammar, and the theology of the apostles Paul and John.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   After initially studying chemistry (receiving a bachelor of
  </p>
  <p>
   science degree from McGill University), Carson went on to receive
  </p>
  <p>
   a master of divinity degree before going to England, where he
  </p>
  <p>
   earned a doctorate in New Testament at prestigious Cambridge
  </p>
  <p>
   University. He taught at three other colleges and seminaries
  </p>
  <p>
   before joining Trinity in 1978. I had never met Carson before I
  </p>
  <p>
   drove onto Trinity's Deerfield, Illinois, campus for our

   interview. Frankly, I was expecting a starched academic. But
  </p>
  <p>
   while I found Carson to be every bit the scholar I had
  </p>
  <p>
   anticipated, I was taken aback by his warm, sincere, and pastoral
  </p>
  <p>
   tone as he responded to what turned out to be, in some cases,
  </p>
  <p>
   rather caustic questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our conversation was held in an otherwise deserted faculty
  </p>
  <p>
   lounge over Christmas break. Carson was wearing a white
  </p>
  <p>
   windbreaker  over a button-down shirt, blue jeans, and Adidas.
  </p>
  <p>
   After some preliminary banter about our mutual appreciation of
  </p>
  <p>
   England (Carson has lived there off and on through the years, and
  </p>
  <p>
   his wife, joy, is British), I pulled out my notebook, started my
  </p>
  <p>
   recorder, and posed a background question to help determine
  </p>
  <p>
   whether Jesus has "the right stuff' to be God.
  </p>
  <h2>
   LIVING AND FORGIVING LIKE GOD
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   My initial question centered on why Carson thinks Jesus is God in
  </p>
  <p>
   the first place. "What did he say or do," I asked, "that
  </p>
  <p>
   convinces you that he is divine?" I wasn't sure how he would
  </p>
  <p>
   respond, although I anticipated he would focus on Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   supernatural feats. I was wrong. "One could point to such things
  </p>
  <p>
   as his miracles," Carson said as he leaned back in the
  </p>
  <p>
   comfortably upholstered chair, "but other people have done
  </p>
  <p>
   miracles, so while this may be indicative, it's not decisive. Of
  </p>
  <p>
   course, the Resurrection was the ultimate vindication of his
  </p>
  <p>
   identity. But of the many things he did, one of the most striking
  </p>
  <p>
   to me is his forgiving of sin."
  </p>
  <p>
   Really?" I said, shifting in my chair, which was perpendicular to
  </p>
  <p>
   his, in order to face him more directly. "How so?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "The point is, if you do something against me, I have the right
  </p>
  <p>
   to forgive you. However, if you do something against me and
  </p>
  <p>
   somebody else comes along and says, 'I forgive you,' what kind of
  </p>
  <p>
   cheek is that? The only person who can say that sort of thing
  </p>
  <p>
   meaningfully is God himself, because sin, even if it is against
  </p>
  <p>
   other people, is first and foremost a defiance of God and his
  </p>
  <p>
   laws.
  </p>
  <p>
   When David sinned by committing adultery and arranging the
  </p>
  <p>
   death of the woman's husband, he ultimately says to God in Psalm
  </p>
  <p>
   51, 'Against you only have I sinned and done this evil in your
  </p>
  <p>
   sight.' He recognized that although he had wronged people, in the
  </p>
  <p>
   end he had sinned against the God who made him in his image, and
  </p>
  <p>
   God needed to forgive him.
  </p>
  <p>
   So along comes Jesus and says to sinners, 'I forgive you.' The
  </p>
  <p>
   Jews immediately recognize the blasphemy of this. They react by
