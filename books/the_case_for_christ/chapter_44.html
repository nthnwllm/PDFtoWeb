  <p>
   people in the gospels and Acts-some individually, some in groups,
  </p>
  <p>
   sometimes indoors, sometimes outdoors, to softhearted people like
  </p>
  <p>
   John and skeptical people like Thomas," he began.
  </p>
  <p>
   At times they touched Jesus or ate with him, with the texts
  </p>
  <p>
   teaching  that he was physically present. The appearances
  </p>
  <p>
   occurred over several  weeks. And there are good reasons to trust
  </p>
  <p>
   these accounts-for example, they're lacking in many typical
  </p>
  <p>
   mythical tendencies." "Can you enumerate these appearances for
  </p>
  <p>
   me?"
  </p>
  <p>
   From memory, Habermas described them one at a time. Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   appeared
  </p>
  <p>
   *  to Mary Magdalene, in John 20:10-18;
  </p>
  <p>
   *  to the other women, in Matthew 28:8-10;
  </p>
  <p>
   *  to Cleopas and another disciple on the road to Emmaus, ul Luke
  </p>
  <p>
   24:13-32;
  </p>
  <p>
   *  to eleven disciples and others, in Luke 24:33-49;
  </p>
  <p>
   *  to ten apostles and others, with Thomas absent, in John
  </p>
  <p>
   20:1923; *  to Thomas and the other apostles, in John 20:26-30;
  </p>
  <p>
   *  to seven apostles, in John 21:1-14;
  </p>
  <p>
   *  to the disciples, in Matthew 28:16-20.
  </p>
  <p>
   *  And he was with the apostles at the Mount of Olives before his
  </p>
  <p>
   ascension, in Luke 24:50-52 and Acts 1:4-9.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It's particularly interesting," Habermas added, "that C. H.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dodd, the Cambridge University scholar, has carefully analyzed
  </p>
  <p>
   these appearances and concluded that several of them are based on
  </p>
  <p>
   especially  early material, including Jesus' encounter with the
  </p>
  <p>
   women, in Matthew 28:8-10; his meeting with the eleven apostles,
  </p>
  <p>
   in which he gave them the Great Commission, in Matthew 28:16-20;
  </p>
  <p>
   and his meeting with the disciples, in John 20:19-23, in which he
  </p>
  <p>
   showed them his hands and side."
  </p>
  <p>
   Again, here was a wealth of sightings of Jesus. This was not
  </p>
  <p>
   merely a fleeting observance of a shadowy figure by one or two
  </p>
  <p>
   people. There were multiple appearances to numerous people,
  </p>
  <p>
   several of the appearances being confirmed in more than one
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel or by the I Corinthians  15 creed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Is there any further corroboration?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Look at Acts," replied Habermas, referring to the New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   book that records the launch of the church. Not only are Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   appearances mentioned regularly, but details are provided, and
  </p>
  <p>
   the theme of the disciples being a witness of these things is
  </p>
  <p>
   found in almost every context.
  </p>
  <p>
   The key," Habermas said, "is that a number of the accounts in
  </p>
  <p>
   Acts 1-5, 10, and 13 also include some creeds that, like the one
  </p>
  <p>
   in 1 Corinthians 15, report some very early data concerning the
  </p>
  <p>
   death and resurrection of Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   With that Habermas picked up a book and read the conclusion of
  </p>
  <p>
   scholar John Drane.
  </p>
  <p>
   'The earliest evidence we have for the resurrection almost
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly  goes back to the time immediately after the
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection
  </p>
  <p>
   event is alleged to have taken place. This is the evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   contained  in the early sermons in the Acts of the Apostles ...
  </p>
  <p>
   there can be no doubt that in the first few chapters of Acts its
  </p>
  <p>
   author has preserved material from very early sources.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed, Acts is littered with references to Jesus' appearances.
  </p>
  <p>
   The apostle Peter was especially adamant about it. He says in
  </p>
  <p>
   Acts 2:32, "God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses of the fact." In Acts 3:15 he repeats, "You killed the
  </p>
  <p>
   author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses of this." He confirms to Cornelius in Acts 10:41 that
  </p>
  <p>
   he and others "ate and drank with him after he rose from the
  </p>
  <p>
   dead."
  </p>
  <p>
   Not to be outdone, Paul said in a speech recorded in Acts 13:31,
  </p>
  <p>
   "For many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him
  </p>
  <p>
   from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our
  </p>
  <p>
   people." Asserted Habermas, "The Resurrection was undoubtedly the
  </p>
  <p>
   central proclamation of the early church from the very beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
   The earliest Christians didn't just endorse Jesus' teachings;
  </p>
  <p>
   they were convinced  they had seen him alive after his
  </p>
  <p>
   crucifixion. That's what changed their lives and started the
  </p>
  <p>
   church. Certainly, since this was their centermost conviction,
  </p>
  <p>
   they would have made absolutely sure that it was true."
  </p>
  <p>
   All of the gospel and Acts evidence - incident after incident,
  </p>
  <p>
   witness  after witness, detail after detail, corroboration on top
  </p>
  <p>
   of corroboration-was  extremely impressive. Although I tried, I
  </p>
  <p>
   couldn't think
  </p>
  <p>
   of any more thoroughly attested event in ancient history.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   However, there was another question that needed to be raised,
  </p>
  <p>
   this one concerning the gospel that most scholars believe was the
  </p>
  <p>
   first account of Jesus to be written.
  </p>
  <h2>
   MARKS MISSING CONCLUSION
  </h2>
  <p>
   When I first began investigating the Resurrection, I encountered
  </p>
  <p>
   a troubling  comment in the margin of my Bible: "The most
  </p>
  <p>
   reliable early manuscripts  and other ancient witnesses do not
  </p>
  <p>
   have Mark 16:9-20." In
  </p>
  <p>
   other words, most scholars believe that the gospel of Mark ends
  </p>
  <p>
   at 16:8, with the women discovering the tomb empty but without
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus having appeared alive to anyone at all. That seemed
  </p>
  <p>
   perplexing.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Doesn't it bother you that the earliest gospel doesn't even
  </p>
  <p>
   report any post-Resurrection appearances?" I asked Habermas.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the contrary, he didn't seemed disturbed at all. "I don't have
  </p>
  <p>
   a problem with that whatsoever," he said. "Sure, it would be nice
  </p>
  <p>
   if he had included a list of appearances, but here are some
  </p>
  <p>
   things for you to think about:
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if Mark does end there, which not everyone believes, you
  </p>
  <p>
   still have him reporting that the tomb is empty, and a young man
  </p>
  <p>
   proclaiming,  'He is risen!' and telling the women that there
  </p>
  <p>
   will be
  </p>
  <p>
   appearances. So you have, first, a proclamation that the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection has occurred, and second, a prediction that
  </p>
  <p>
   appearances will follow. You can close your favorite novel and
  </p>
  <p>
   say, 'I can't believe the author's not telling me the next
  </p>
  <p>
   episode,' but you can't close the book and say, 'The writer
  </p>
  <p>
   doesn't believe in the next episode.' Mark definitely  does. He
  </p>
  <p>
   obviously believed the Resurrection had taken place. He ends with
  </p>
  <p>
   the women being told that Jesus will appear in Galilee, and then
  </p>
  <p>
   others later confirm that he did."
  </p>
  <p>
   According to church tradition, Mark was a companion of the
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitness  Peter. "Isn't it odd," I asked, "that Mark wouldn't
  </p>
  <p>
   mention that Jesus appeared to Peter, if he really had?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Mark doesn't mention any appearances, so it wouldn't be peculiar
  </p>
  <p>
   that Peter isn't listed," he said. "However, note that Mark does
  </p>
  <p>
   single out Peter. Mark 16:7 says, 'But go, tell his disciples and
  </p>
  <p>
   Peter, He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see
  </p>
  <p>
   him, just as he told you'
  </p>
  <p>
   This agrees with 1 Corinthians 15:5, which confirms that Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   did appear to Peter, and Luke 24:34, another early creed, which
  </p>
  <p>
   says, It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon,'
  </p>
  <p>
   or Peter. So what Mark predicts about Peter is reported to have
  </p>
  <p>
   been fulfilled,  in two early and very reliable creeds of the
  </p>
  <p>
   church-as well as by Peter himself in Acts."
  </p>
  <h2>
   ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Without question, the amount of testimony and corroboration of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' post-Resurrection appearances is staggering. To put it
  </p>
  <p>
   into perspective,  if you were to call each one of the witnesses
  </p>
  <p>
   to a court of law to be cross-examined for just fifteen minutes
  </p>
  <p>
   each, and you went around the clock without a break, it would
  </p>
  <p>
   take you from breakfast on Monday  until dinner on Friday to hear
  </p>
  <p>
   them all. After listening to 129 straight hours of eyewitness
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony, who could possibly walk away unconvinced?
  </p>
  <p>
   Having been a legal affairs journalist who has covered scores of
  </p>
  <p>
   trials, both criminal and civil, I had to agree with the
  </p>
  <p>
   assessment of Sir Edward Clarke, a British High Court judge who
  </p>
  <p>
   conducted a thorough  legal analysis of the first Easter Day: "To
  </p>
  <p>
   me the evidence is conclusive, and over and over again in the
  </p>
  <p>
   High Court I have secured the verdict on evidence not nearly so
  </p>
  <p>
   compelling. As a lawyer I accept the gospel evidence unreservedly
  </p>
  <p>
   as the testimony of truthful men to facts that they were able to
  </p>
  <p>
   substantiate."
  </p>
  <p>
   However, could there be any plausible alternatives that could
  </p>
  <p>
   explain away these encounters with the risen Jesus? Could these
  </p>
  <p>
   accounts be legendary in nature? Or might the witnesses have
  </p>
  <p>
   experiienced  hallucinations? I decided to raise those issues
  </p>
  <p>
   with Habermas to get his response.
  </p>
  <p>
   Possibility 1: The Appearances Are Legendary
  </p>
  <p>
   If it's true that the gospel of Mark originally ended before any
  </p>
  <p>
   appearances were reported, it could be argued that there's
  </p>
  <p>
   evolutionary  development in the gospels: Mark records no
  </p>
  <p>
   appearances,
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew has some, Luke has more, and John has the most.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Doesn't that demonstrate that the appearances are merely legends
  </p>
  <p>
   that grew up over time?" I asked.

   "For a lot of reasons, no, it doesn't," Habermas assured me.
  </p>
  <p>
   "First, not everybody believes Mark is the earliest gospel. There
  </p>
  <p>
   are scholars, admittedly in the minority, who believe Matthew was
  </p>
  <p>
   written first. Second, even if I accept your thesis as true, it
  </p>
  <p>
   only proves that legends grew up over time-it can't explain away
  </p>
  <p>
   the original belief that Jesus was risen from the dead. Something
  </p>
  <p>
   happened that prompted the apostles to make the Resurrection the
  </p>
  <p>
   central proclamation  of the earliest church. Legend can't
  </p>
  <p>
   explain those initial eyewitness  accounts. In other words,
  </p>
  <p>
   legend can tell you how a story got bigger; it can't tell you how
  </p>
  <p>
   it originated when the participants are both eyewitnesses and
  </p>
  <p>
   reported the events early.
  </p>
  <p>
   Third, you're forgetting that the I Corinthians 15 creed predates
  </p>
  <p>
   any of the gospels, and it makes huge claims about the
  </p>
  <p>
   appearances. In fact, the claim involving the biggest number-that
  </p>
  <p>
   he was seen alive by five hundred people at once-goes back to
  </p>
  <p>
   this earliest source! That creates problems for the legendary-
  </p>
  <p>
   development theory. The best reasons for rejecting the legend
  </p>
  <p>
   theory come from the early creedal accounts in 1 Corinthians 15
  </p>
  <p>
   and Acts, both of which predate  the gospel material.
  </p>
  <p>
   And fourth, what about the empty tomb? If the Resurrection
  </p>
  <p>
   were merely a legend, the tomb would be filled. However, it was
  </p>
  <p>
   empty on Easter Morning. That demands an additional hypothesis."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Possibility 2: The Appearances Were Hallucinations
  </p>
  <p>
   Maybe the witnesses were sincere in believing they saw Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps they accurately recorded what took place. But could they
  </p>
  <p>
   have been seeing a hallucination that convinced them they were
  </p>
  <p>
   encountering Jesus when they really weren't?
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas smiled at the question. "Do you know Gary Collins?" he
  </p>
  <p>
   asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   That question took me off guard. Sure, I replied, I know him. "I
  </p>
  <p>
   was in his office just recently to interview him for this same
  </p>
  <p>
   book," I said. "Do you believe he's qualified as a psychologist?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas asked. "Yes," I answered warily, since! I could tell he
  </p>
  <p>
   was setting me up for something. "A doctorate, a prof;essor for
  </p>
  <p>
   twenty years, the author of dozens of books on psychological
  </p>
  <p>
   issues, president of a national association of psychologists-
  </p>
  <p>
   yeah,, sure, I'd consider him qualified." Habermas, handed me a
  </p>
  <p>
   piece (of paper. "I asked Gary about the possibility that these
  </p>
  <p>
   were hallucinations, and this is his professional opinion," he
  </p>
  <p>
   told me. I looked at the document.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hallucinations are individual occurrences. By their very nature
  </p>
  <p>
   only one person can see a given hallucination at a time. They
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly aren't something which can be seen by a group of
  </p>
  <p>
   people. Neither is it possible that one person could somehow
  </p>
  <p>
   induce an hallucination in somebody else. Since an hallucination
  </p>
  <p>
   exists only in this subjective, personal sense, it is obvious
