  <p>
   lesser God. Are they right?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carson sighed. "My father was a preacher," he replied, "and a
  </p>
  <p>
   dictum in our home when I was growing up was, 'A text without a
  </p>
  <p>
   context  becomes a pretext for a proof text.' It's very important
  </p>
  <p>
   to see this passage in its context.
  </p>
  <p>
   The disciples are moaning because Jesus has said he's going away.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus says, 'If you loved me, you'd be glad for my sake when I
  </p>
  <p>
   say I'm going away, because the Father is greater than V That is
  </p>
  <p>
   to say, Jesus is returning to the glory that is properly his, so
  </p>
  <p>
   if they really know who he is and really love him properly,
  </p>
  <p>
   they'll be glad that he's going back to the realm where he really
  </p>
  <p>
   is greater. Jesus says in John 17:5, 'Glorify me with the glory
  </p>
  <p>
   that I had with the Father before the world began'-that is, 'the
  </p>
  <p>
   Father is greater than V
  </p>
  <p>
   "When you use a category like 'greater,' it doesn't have to mean
  </p>
  <p>
   ontologically greater. If I say, for example, that the president
  </p>
  <p>
   of the United States is greater than I, I'm not saying he's an
  </p>
  <p>
   ontologically superior being. He's greater in military
  </p>
  <p>
   capability, political prowess, and public acclaim, but he's not
  </p>
  <p>
   more of a man than I am. He's a human being and I'm a human
  </p>
  <p>
   being.
  </p>
  <p>
   So when Jesus says, 'The Father is greater than I,' one must look
  </p>
  <p>
   at the context and ask if Jesus is saying, 'The Father is greater
  </p>
  <p>
   than I because he's God and I'm not.' Frankly, that would be a
  </p>
  <p>
   pretty ridiculous thing to say. Suppose I got up on some podium
  </p>
  <p>
   to preach and said, 'I solemnly declare to you that God is
  </p>
  <p>
   greater than I am.' That would be a rather useless observation.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The comparison is only meaningful if they're already on the same
  </p>
  <p>
   plane and there's some delimitation going on. Jesus is in the
  </p>
  <p>
   limitations of the Incamation-he's going to the cross; he's going
  </p>
  <p>
   to die-but he's about to return to the Father and to the glory he
  </p>
  <p>
   had with the Father before the world began.
  </p>
  <p>
   He's saying, 'You guys are moaning for my sake; you ought to be
  </p>
  <p>
   glad because I'm going home.' It's in that sense that 'the Father
  </p>
  <p>
   is greater than I"'
  </p>
  <p>
   "So," I said, "this isn't an implicit denial of his deity." "No,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he concluded, "it's really not. The context makes that clear."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While I was ready to accept the fact that Jesus was not a lesser
  </p>
  <p>
   God, I had a different and more sensitive issue to raise: how
  </p>
  <p>
   could Jesus be a compassionate God yet endorse the idea of
  </p>
  <p>
   eternal suffering  for those who reject him?
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE DISQUIETING QUESTION OF HELL
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The Bible says that the Father is loving. The New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   affirms the same about Jesus. But can they really be loving while
  </p>
  <p>
   at the same time sending people to hell? After all, Jesus teaches
  </p>
  <p>
   more about hell than anyone in the entire Bible. Doesn't that
  </p>
  <p>
   contradict his supposed gentle and compassionate character?
  </p>
  <p>
   In posing this question to Carson, I quoted the hard-edged words
  </p>
  <p>
   of agnostic Charles Templeton: "How could a loving Heavenly
  </p>
  <p>
   Father create an endless hell and, over the centuries, consign
  </p>
  <p>
   millions of people to it because they do not or cannot or will
  </p>
  <p>
   not accept certain religious beliefs?"
  </p>
  <p>
   That question, though tweaked for maximum impact, didn't raise
  </p>
  <p>
   Carson's ire. He began with a clarification. "First of all," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "I'm not sure that God simply casts people into hell
  </p>
  <p>
   because they don't accept certain beliefs."
  </p>
  <p>
   He thought for a moment, then backed up to take a run at a more
  </p>
  <p>
   thorough answer by discussing a subject that many modern people
  </p>
  <p>
   consider a quaint anachronism: sin.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Picture God in the beginning of creation with a man and woman
  </p>
  <p>
   made in his image," Carson said. "They wake up in the morning and
  </p>
  <p>
   think about God. They love him truly. They delight to do what he
  </p>
  <p>
   wants; it's their whole pleasure. They're rightly related to him
  </p>
  <p>
   and they're rightly related to each other.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, with the entrance of sin and rebellion into the world,
  </p>
  <p>
   these image bearers begin to think that they are at the center of
  </p>
  <p>
   the universe.  Not literally, but that's the way they think. And
  </p>
  <p>
   that's the way we think. All the things we call 'social
  </p>
  <p>
   pathologies'-war, rape, bitterness, nurtured envies, secret
  </p>
  <p>
   jealousies, pride, inferiority complexes;-are  bound up in the
  </p>
  <p>
   first instance with the fact that we're
  </p>
  <p>
   not rightly related with God. The consequence is that people get
  </p>
  <p>
   hurt. From God's perspective, that is shockingly disgusting. So
  </p>
  <p>
   what should God do about it? If he says, 'Well, I don't give a
  </p>
  <p>
   rip,' he's saying that evil doesn't matter to him. It's a bit
  </p>
  <p>
   like saying, "Oh yeah, the Holocaust-I don't care." Wouldn't we
  </p>
  <p>
   be shocked if we thought God didn't have moral judgments on such
  </p>
  <p>
   matters?
  </p>
  <p>
   But in principle, if he's the sort of God who has moral judgments
  </p>
  <p>
   on those matters, he's got to have moral judgments on this huge
  </p>
  <p>
   matter  of all these divine image bearers shaking their puny
  </p>
  <p>
   fists at his face and singing with Frank Sinatra, 'I did it my
  </p>
  <p>
   way.' That's the real nature of sin.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having said that, hell is not a place where people are consigned
  </p>
  <p>
   because they were pretty good blokes but just didn't believe the
  </p>
  <p>
   right stuff. They're consigned there, first and foremost, because
  </p>
  <p>
   they defy their Maker and want to be at the center of the
  </p>
  <p>
   universe. Hell is not filled with people who have already
  </p>
  <p>
   repented, only God isn't gentle enough or good enough to let them
  </p>
  <p>
   out. It's filled with people who, for all eternity, still want to
  </p>
  <p>
   be at the center of the universe and who persist  in their God-
  </p>
  <p>
   defying rebellion.
  </p>
  <p>
   What is God to do? If he says it doesn't matter to him, God is no
  </p>
  <p>
   longer a God to be admired. He's either amoral or positively
  </p>
  <p>
   creepy. For him to act in any other way in the face of such
  </p>
  <p>
   blatant defiance would be to reduce God himself."
  </p>
  <p>
   I interjected, "Yes, but what seems to bother people the most is
  </p>
  <p>
   the idea that God will torment people for eternity. That seems
  </p>
  <p>
   vicious, doesn't it?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Replied Carson, "In the first place, the Bible says that there
  </p>
  <p>
   are different degrees of punishment, so I'm not sure that it's
  </p>
  <p>
   the same level of intensity for all people.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the second place, if God took his hands off this fallen world
  </p>
  <p>
   so that there were no restraint on human wickedness, we would
  </p>
  <p>
   make hell. Thus if you allow a whole lot of sinners to live
  </p>
  <p>
   somewhere in a confined place where they're not doing damage to
  </p>
  <p>
   anyone but themselves,  what do you get but hell? There's a sense
  </p>
  <p>
   in which they're doing it to themselves, and it's what they want
  </p>
  <p>
   because they still don't repent."
  </p>
  <p>
   I thought Carson was finished with his answer, because he
  </p>
  <p>
   hesitated  for a moment. However, he had one more crucial point.
  </p>
  <p>
   "One of the things that the Bible does insist is that in the end
  </p>
  <p>
   not only will justice be done, but justice will be seen to be
  </p>
  <p>
   done, so that every mouth will be stopped."
  </p>
  <p>
   I grabbed ahold of that last statement. "In other words," I said,
  </p>
  <p>
   4'at the time of judgment there is nobody in the world who will
  </p>
  <p>
   walk away from that experience saying that they have been treated
  </p>
  <p>
   unfairly by God. Everyone will recognize the fundamental justice
  </p>
  <p>
   in the way God judges them and the world."
  </p>
  <p>
   "That's right," Carson said firmly. "Justice is not always done
  </p>
  <p>
   in this world; we see that every day. But on the Last Day it will
  </p>
  <p>
   be done for all to see. And no one will be able to complain by
  </p>
  <p>
   saying, 'This isn't fair."'
  </p>
  <h2>
   JESUS AND SLAVERY
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   There was one other issue I wanted to raise with Carson. I
  </p>
  <p>
   glanced at my watch. "Do you have a few more minutes?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   When he indicated  he did, I began to address one more
  </p>
  <p>
   controversial topic.
  </p>
  <p>
   To be God, Jesus must be ethically perfect. But some critics of
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity have charged that he fell short because, they say,
  </p>
  <p>
   he tacitly  approved of the morally abhorrent practice of
  </p>
  <p>
   slavery. As Morton Smith wrote,
  </p>
  <p>
   There were innumerable slaves of the emperor and of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman state; the Jerusalem Temple owned slaves; the High
  </p>
  <p>
   Priest owned slaves (one of them lost an ear in Jesus' arrest);
  </p>
  <p>
   all of the rich and almost all of the middle class owned slaves.
  </p>
  <p>
   So far as we are told, Jesus never attacked this practice....
  </p>
  <p>
   There seem to have been slave revolts in Palestine and Jordan in
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' youth; a miracle-working leader of such a revolt
  </p>
  <p>
   would have attracted a large following. If Jesus had denounced
  </p>
  <p>
   slavery or promised liberation, we should almost certainly
  </p>
  <p>
   have heard of his doing it. We hear nothing, so the most likely
  </p>
  <p>
   supposition is that he said nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
   How can Jesus' failure to push for the abolition of slavery be
  </p>
  <p>
   squared with God's love for all people?
  </p>
  <p>
   "Why didn't Jesus stand up
  </p>
  <p>
   and shout, 'Slavery is wrong'?" I asked. "Was he morally
  </p>
  <p>
   deficient for not working to dismantle an institution that
  </p>
  <p>
   demeaned people who were made in the image of God?"
  </p>

   Carson straightened up in his chair. "I really think that people
  </p>
  <p>
   who raise that objection are missing the point," he said. "If
  </p>
  <p>
   you'll permit  me, I'll set the stage by talking about slavery,
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient and modern,  because in our culture the issue is
  </p>
  <p>
   understandably charged with overtones that it didn't have in the
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient world."

   I gestured for him to continue. "Please go ahead," I said.

  <h2>
   OVERTHROWING OPPRESSION
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "In his book Race and Culture,' African-Anerican scholar Thomas
  </p>
  <p>
   Sowell points out that every major world culture until the modern
  </p>
  <p>
   period, without exception, has had slavery," Carson explained.
  </p>
  <p>
   "While it could be tied to military conquest, usually slavery
  </p>
  <p>
   served an economic function. They didn't have bankruptcy laws, so
  </p>
  <p>
   if you got yourself into terrible hock, you sold yourself and/or
  </p>
  <p>
   your family into slavery. As it was discharging a debt, slavery
  </p>
  <p>
   was also providing work. It wasn't necessarily all bad; at least
  </p>
  <p>
   it was an option for survival.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Please understand me: I'm not trying to romanticize slavery in
  </p>
  <p>
   any way. However, in Roman times there were menial laborers who
  </p>
  <p>
   were slaves, and there were also others who were the equivalent
  </p>
  <p>
   of distinguished Ph.D.'s, who were teaching families. And there
  </p>
  <p>
   was no association of a particular race with slavery.
  </p>
  <p>
   In American slavery, though, all blacks and only blacks were
  </p>
  <p>
   slaves. That was one of the peculiar horrors of it, and it
  </p>
  <p>
   generated an unfair sense of black inferiority that many of us
  </p>
  <p>
   continue to fight to this day.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now let's look at the Bible. In Jewish society, under the Law
  </p>
  <p>
   everyone was to be freed every Jubilee. In other words, there was
  </p>
  <p>
   a slavery ban every seventh year. Whether or not things actually
  </p>
  <p>
   worked out that way, this was nevertheless what God said, and
  </p>
  <p>
   this was the framework in which Jesus was brought up.
  </p>
  <p>
   But you have to keep your eye on Jesus' mission. Essentially, he
  </p>
  <p>
   did not come to overturn the Roman economic system, which
  </p>
  <p>
   included slavery. He came to free men and women from their sins.
  </p>
  <p>
   And here's my point: what his message does is transform people so
  </p>
  <p>
   they begin to love God with all their heart, soul, mind, and
  </p>
  <p>
   strength and to love their neighbor as themselves. Naturally,
  </p>
  <p>
   that has an impact on the idea of slavery.
  </p>
  <p>
   Look at what the apostle Paul says in his letter to Philemon
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning  a runaway slave named Onesimus. Paul doesn't say to
  </p>
  <p>
   overthrow  slavery, because all that would do would be to get him
  </p>
  <p>
   executed. Instead he tells Philemon he'd better treat Onesimus as
  </p>
  <p>
   a brother in Christ, just as he would treat Paul himself. And
  </p>
  <p>
   then, to make matters  perfectly clear, Paul emphasizes,
  </p>
  <p>
   'Remeniber, you owe your whole life to me because of the gospel.'
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The overthrowing of slavery, then, is through the transformation
  </p>
  <p>
   of men and women by the gospel rather than through merely
  </p>
  <p>
   changing  an economic system. We've all seen what can happen when
  </p>
  <p>
   you merely overthrow an economic system and impose a new order.

   The whole communist dream was to have a 'revolutionary man'
