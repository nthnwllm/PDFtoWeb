  <p>
   scholarship of the Jesus Seminar is correct." In sum, the Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   of faith is the same as the Jesus of history.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS REALLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS THE SON
  </h2>
  <h2>
   OF GOD?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   By going back to the very earliest traditions, which are
  </p>
  <p>
   unquestionably safe from legendary development, Ben Witherington
  </p>
  <p>
   III was able to show that Jesus had a supreme and transcendent
  </p>
  <p>
   self-understanding. Based on the evidence, Witherington said,
  </p>
  <p>
   "Did Jesus believe he was the Son of God, the anointed one of
  </p>
  <p>
   God? The answer is yes. Did he see himself as the Son of Man? The
  </p>
  <p>
   answer is yes. Did he see himself as the final Messiah? Yes,
  </p>
  <p>
   that's the way he viewed himself. Did he believe that anybody
  </p>
  <p>
   less than God could save the world? No, I don't believe he did."
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS CRAZY WHEN HE CLAIMED TO BE THE SON
  </h2>
  <h2>
   OF GOD?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Well-known psychologist Gary Collins said Jesus exhibited no
  </p>
  <p>
   inappropriate  emotions, was in contact with reality, was
  </p>
  <p>
   brilliant and had amazing insights into human nature, and enjoyed
  </p>
  <p>
   deep and abiding relationships. "I just don't see signs that
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus was suffering from any known mental illness," he concluded.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, Jesus backed up his claim to being God through
  </p>
  <p>
   miraculous feats of healing, astounding demonstrations of power
  </p>
  <p>
   over nature, unrivaled teaching, divine understanding of people,
  </p>
  <p>
   and with his own resurrection, which was the final authentication
  </p>
  <p>
   of his identity.
  </p>
  <h2>
   DID JESUS FULFILL THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While the Incarnation-God becoming man, the infinite becoming
  </p>
  <p>
   finite-stretches our imagination, prominent theologian D. A.
  </p>
  <p>
   Carson pointed out that there's lots of evidence that Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   exhibited the characteristics  of deity. Based on Philippians 2,
  </p>
  <p>
   many theologians believe Jesus voluntarily emptied himself of the
  </p>
  <p>
   independent use of these divine attributes as he pursued his
  </p>
  <p>
   mission of human redemption. Even so, the New Testament
  </p>
  <p>
   specifically confirms that Jesus ultimately  possessed every
  </p>
  <p>
   qualification of deity, including omniscience, omnipresence,
  </p>
  <p>
   omnipotence, eternality, and immutability.
  </p>
  <h2>
   DID JESUS-AND JESUS ALONE-MATCH THE IDENTITY
  </h2>
  <h2>
   OF THE MESSIAH?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, prophets foretold the
  </p>
  <p>
   coming  of the Messiah, or the Anointed One, who would redeem
  </p>
  <p>
   God's people. In effect, dozens of these Old Testament prophecies
  </p>
  <p>
   created a fingerprint that only the true Messiah could fit. This
  </p>
  <p>
   gave Israel a way to rule out impostors and validate the
  </p>
  <p>
   credentials of the authentic  Messiah. Against astronomical odds-
  </p>
  <p>
   one chance in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,
  </p>
  <p>
   trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,  trillion,
  </p>
  <p>
   trillion, trillion-Jesus, and only Jesus throughout history,
  </p>
  <p>
   matched this prophetic fingerprint. This confirms Jesus' identity
  </p>
  <p>
   to an incredible degree of certainty.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS' DEATH A SHAM AND HIS RESURRECTION A
  </h2>
  <h2>
   HOAX?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   By analyzing the medical and historical data, Dr. Alexander
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell concluded Jesus could not have survived the gruesome
  </p>
  <p>
   rigors of crucifixion,  much less the gaping wound that pierced
  </p>
  <p>
   his lung and heart. The idea that he somehow swooned on the cross
  </p>
  <p>
   and pretended to be dead lacks any evidential basis. Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   executioners were grimly efficient,  knowing that they themselves
  </p>
  <p>
   would face death if any of their victims were to come down from
  </p>
  <p>
   the cross alive. Even if Jesus had somehow lived through the
  </p>
  <p>
   torture, his ghastly condition could never have inspired a
  </p>
  <p>
   worldwide movement based on the premise that he had gloriously
  </p>
  <p>
   triumphed over the grave.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS' BODY REALLY ABSENT FROM HIS TOMB?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   William Lane Craig presented striking evidence that the enduring
  </p>
  <p>
   symbol of Easter-the vacant tomb of Jesus-was a historical
  </p>
  <p>
   reality.  The empty grave is reported or implied in extremely
  </p>
  <p>
   early
  </p>
  <p>
   sources-Mark's gospel and the 1 Corinthians 15 creed-which date
  </p>
  <p>
   so close to the event that they could not possibly have been
  </p>
  <p>
   products of legend. The fact that the gospels report that women
  </p>
  <p>
   discovered the empty tomb bolsters the story's authenticity. The
  </p>
  <p>
   site of Jesus' tomb was known to both Christian and Jew alike, so
  </p>
  <p>
   it could have been checked by skeptics. In fact, nobody, not even
  </p>
  <p>
   the Roman authorities or Jewish leaders, ever claimed that the
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb still contained Jesus' body. Instead they were forced to
  </p>
  <p>
   invent the absurd story that the disciples,  despite having no
  </p>
  <p>
   motive or opportunity, had stolen the
  </p>
  <p>
   body-a theory that not even the most skeptical critic believes
  </p>
  <p>
   today.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS SEEN ALIVE AFTER HIS DEATH ON THE
  </h2>
  <h2>
   CROSS?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The evidence for the post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't develop gradually over the years as mythology distorted
  </p>
  <p>
   memories of his life. Rather, said Resurrection expert Gary
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas, the Resurrection  was "the central proclamation of the
  </p>
  <p>
   early church from the very beginning." The ancient creed from I
  </p>
  <p>
   Corinthians 15 mentions specific individuals who encountered the
  </p>
  <p>
   risen Christ, and Paul even challenged first-century doubters to
  </p>
  <p>
   talk with these individuals personally  to determine the truth of
  </p>
  <p>
   the matter for themselves. The book of Acts is littered with
  </p>
  <p>
   extremely early affirmations of Jesus' resurrection,  while the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels describe numerous encounters in detail.
  </p>
  <p>
   Concluded British theologian Michael Green, "The appearances of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus are as well authenticated as anything in antiquity... There
  </p>
  <p>
   can be no rational doubt that they occurred."
  </p>
  <h2>
   ARE THERE ANY SUPPORTING FACTS THAT POINT TO
  </h2>
  <h2>
   THE RESURRECTION?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   J. P. Moreland's circumstantial evidence added final
  </p>
  <p>
   documentation for the Resurrection. First, the disciples were in
  </p>
  <p>
   a unique position to know whether the Resurrection happened, and
  </p>
  <p>
   they went to their deaths proclaiming it was true. Nobody
  </p>
  <p>
   knowingly and willingly dies for a lie. Second, apart from the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection, there's no good reason why skeptics like Paul and
  </p>
  <p>
   James would have been converted and would have died for their
  </p>
  <p>
   faith. Third, within weeks of the Crucifixion,  thousands of Jews
  </p>
  <p>
   began abandoning key social practices that had critical
  </p>
  <p>
   sociological and religious importance for centuries. They
  </p>
  <p>
   believed they risked damnation if they were wrong. Fourth, the
  </p>
  <p>
   early sacraments of Communion and baptism affirmed Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection and deity. And fifth, the miraculous emergence of
  </p>
  <p>
   the cburch in the face of brutal Roman persecution "rips a great
  </p>
  <p>
   hole in history, a hole the size and shape of Resurrection," as
  </p>
  <p>
   C. F. D. Moule put it. FAILING MULLER?S CHALLENGE
  </p>
  <p>
   I'll admit it: I was ambushed by the amount and quality of the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence  that Jesus is the unique Son of God. As I sat at my
  </p>
  <p>
   desk that Sunday afternoon, I shook my head in amazement. I had
  </p>
  <p>
   seen defendants  carted off to the death chamber on much less
  </p>
  <p>
   convincing proof! The cumulative facts and data pointed
  </p>
  <p>
   unmistakably toward a conclusion  that I wasn't entirely
  </p>
  <p>
   comfortable in reaching.
  </p>
  <p>
   Frankly, I had wanted to believe that the deification of Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   was the result of legendary development in which well-meaning but
  </p>
  <p>
   misguided  people slowly turned a wise sage into the mythological
  </p>
  <p>
   Son of God. That seemed safe and reassuring; after all, a roving
  </p>
  <p>
   apocalyptic preacher from the first century could make no demands
  </p>
  <p>
   on me. But while I went into my investigation thinking that this
  </p>
  <p>
   legendary explanation was intuitively obvious, I emerged
  </p>
  <p>
   convinced it was totally without basis. What clinched it for me
  </p>
  <p>
   was the famous study by A. N. SherwinWhite,  the great classical
  </p>
  <p>
   historian from Oxford University, which William lane Craig
  </p>
  <p>
   alluded to in our interview. Sherwin-White meticulously  examined
  </p>
  <p>
   the rate at which legend accrued in the ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   world. His conclusion: not even two full generations was enough
  </p>
  <p>
   time for legend to develop and to wipe out a solid core of
  </p>
  <p>
   historical truth. Now consider the case of Jesus. Historically
  </p>
  <p>
   speaking, the news of his empty tomb, the eyewitness accounts of
  </p>
  <p>
   his post-Resurrection appearances, and the conviction that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   indeed God's unique Son emerged virtually instantaneously.
  </p>
  <p>
   The I Corinthians 15 creed, affirming Jesus' death for our sins
  </p>
  <p>
   and listing his post-Resurrection appearances to named
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitnesses, was already being recited by Christians as soon as
  </p>
  <p>
   twenty-four months after the Crucifixion. Mark's account of the
  </p>
  <p>
   empty tomb was drawn from material that dates back to within a
  </p>
  <p>
   few years of the event itself The gospels, attesting to Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   teachings, miracles, and resurrection,  were circulating within
  </p>
  <p>
   the lifetimes of Jesus' contemporaries, who would have been only
  </p>
  <p>
   too glad to set the record straight if there had been
  </p>
  <p>
   embellishment or falsehood. The most primitive Christian hymns
  </p>
  <p>
   affirm Jesus' divine nature.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg summed it up this way: "Within the first two years after
  </p>
  <p>
   his death, then, significant numbers of Jesus' followers seem to
  </p>
  <p>
   have formulated a doctrine of the atonement, were convinced that
  </p>
  <p>
   he had been raised from the dead in bodily form, associated Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   with God, and believed they found support for all these
  </p>
  <p>
   convictions in the Old Testament  ."
  </p>
  <p>
   Concluded William Lane Craig, "The time span necessary for
  </p>
  <p>
   significant  accrual of legend concerning the events of the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospels would place us in the second century A.D.Just the time in
  </p>
  <p>
   fact when the legendary  apocryphal gospels were born. These are
  </p>
  <p>
   the legendary
  </p>
  <p>
   accounts sought by the critics."
  </p>
  <p>
   There was simply nowhere near enough time for mythology to
  </p>
  <p>
   thoroughly corrupt the historical record of Jesus, especially in
  </p>
  <p>
   the midst of eyewitnesses who still had personal knowledge of
  </p>
  <p>
   him. When German theologian Julius Maller in 1844 challenged
  </p>
  <p>
   anyone to find a single example of legend developing that fast
  </p>
  <p>
   anywhere in history, the response from the scholars of his day-
  </p>
  <p>
   and to the present time was  resounding silence  .
  </p>
  <p>
   On November 8, 1981, I realized that my biggest objection to
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus also had been quieted by the evidence of history. I found
  </p>
  <p>
   myself chuckling at how the tables had been turned.
  </p>
  <p>
   In light of the convincing facts I had learned during my
  </p>
  <p>
   investigation,  in the face of this overwhelming avalanche of
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence in the case for Christ, the great irony was this: it
  </p>
  <p>
   would require much more faith for me to maintain my atheism than
  </p>
  <p>
   to trust in Jesus of Nazareth! IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE
  </p>
  <p>
   Remember the story of James Dixon in the introduction of this
  </p>
  <p>
   book? The evidence pointed powerfully toward his guilt for
  </p>
  <p>
   shooting a Chicago police sergeant. He even admitted he did it!
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet when a more thorough investigation was conducted, suddenly a
  </p>
  <p>
   shift occurred: the scenario that fit the facts most perfectly
  </p>
  <p>
   was that the sergeant had framed Dixon, who was innocent of the
  </p>
  <p>
   shooting. Dixon was set free, and it was the officer who found
  </p>
  <p>
   himself convicted. As we conclude our investigation in the case
  </p>
  <p>
   for Christ, it's worth revisiting the two big lessons from that
  </p>
  <p>
   story.
  </p>
  <p>
   First, Has the Collection of Evidence Really Been Thorough? Yes,
  </p>
  <p>
   it has been. I selected experts who could state their position
  </p>
  <p>
   and defend it with historical evidence that I could then test
  </p>
  <p>
   through cross-examination. I wasn't merely interested in their
  </p>
  <p>
   opinions; I wanted facts. I challenged them with the current
  </p>
  <p>
   theories of atheists and liberal professors. Given their
  </p>
  <p>
   background, credentials, experience,  and character, these
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars were more than qualified to present  reliable historical
  </p>
  <p>
   data concerning Jesus.
