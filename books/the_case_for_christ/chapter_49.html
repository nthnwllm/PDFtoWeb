   scholarship of the Jesus Seminar is correct." In sum, the Jesus of faith is the same as the Jesus of history.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS REALLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS THE SON
  </h2>
  <h2>
   OF GOD?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   By going back to the very earliest traditions, which are unquestionably safe from legendary development, Ben Witherington III was able to show that Jesus had a supreme and transcendent self-understanding. Based on the evidence, Witherington said, "Did Jesus believe he was the Son of God, the anointed one of God? The answer is yes. Did he see himself as the Son of Man? The answer is yes. Did he see himself as the final Messiah? Yes, that's the way he viewed himself. Did he believe that anybody less than God could save the world? No, I don't believe he did."
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS CRAZY WHEN HE CLAIMED TO BE THE SON
  </h2>
  <h2>
   OF GOD?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Well-known psychologist Gary Collins said Jesus exhibited no inappropriate  emotions, was in contact with reality, was brilliant and had amazing insights into human nature, and enjoyed deep and abiding relationships. "I just don't see signs that Jesus was suffering from any known mental illness," he concluded. In addition, Jesus backed up his claim to being God through miraculous feats of healing, astounding demonstrations of power over nature, unrivaled teaching, divine understanding of people, and with his own resurrection, which was the final authentication of his identity.
  </p>
  <h2>
   DID JESUS FULFILL THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While the Incarnation-God becoming man, the infinite becoming finite-stretches our imagination, prominent theologian D. A. Carson pointed out that there's lots of evidence that Jesus exhibited the characteristics  of deity. Based on Philippians 2, many theologians believe Jesus voluntarily emptied himself of the independent use of these divine attributes as he pursued his mission of human redemption. Even so, the New Testament specifically confirms that Jesus ultimately  possessed every qualification of deity, including omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, eternality, and immutability.
  </p>
  <h2>
   DID JESUS-AND JESUS ALONE-MATCH THE IDENTITY
  </h2>
  <h2>
   OF THE MESSIAH?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, prophets foretold the coming  of the Messiah, or the Anointed One, who would redeem God's people. In effect, dozens of these Old Testament prophecies created a fingerprint that only the true Messiah could fit. This gave Israel a way to rule out impostors and validate the credentials of the authentic  Messiah. Against astronomical odds- one chance in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,  trillion, trillion, trillion-Jesus, and only Jesus throughout history, matched this prophetic fingerprint. This confirms Jesus' identity to an incredible degree of certainty.

   WAS JESUS' DEATH A SHAM AND HIS RESURRECTION A
  </h2>
  <h2>
   HOAX?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   By analyzing the medical and historical data, Dr. Alexander Metherell concluded Jesus could not have survived the gruesome rigors of crucifixion,  much less the gaping wound that pierced his lung and heart. The idea that he somehow swooned on the cross and pretended to be dead lacks any evidential basis. Roman executioners were grimly efficient,  knowing that they themselves would face death if any of their victims were to come down from the cross alive. Even if Jesus had somehow lived through the torture, his ghastly condition could never have inspired a worldwide movement based on the premise that he had gloriously triumphed over the grave.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS' BODY REALLY ABSENT FROM HIS TOMB?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   William Lane Craig presented striking evidence that the enduring symbol of Easter-the vacant tomb of Jesus-was a historical reality.  The empty grave is reported or implied in extremely early sources-Mark's gospel and the 1 Corinthians 15 creed-which date so close to the event that they could not possibly have been products of legend. The fact that the gospels report that women discovered the empty tomb bolsters the story's authenticity. The site of Jesus' tomb was known to both Christian and Jew alike, so it could have been checked by skeptics. In fact, nobody, not even the Roman authorities or Jewish leaders, ever claimed that the tomb still contained Jesus' body. Instead they were forced to invent the absurd story that the disciples,  despite having no motive or opportunity, had stolen the body-a theory that not even the most skeptical critic believes today.

   CROSS?

   The evidence for the post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus didn't develop gradually over the years as mythology distorted memories of his life. Rather, said Resurrection expert Gary Habermas, the Resurrection  was "the central proclamation of the early church from the very beginning." The ancient creed from I Corinthians 15 mentions specific individuals who encountered the risen Christ, and Paul even challenged first-century doubters to talk with these individuals personally  to determine the truth of the matter for themselves. The book of Acts is littered with extremely early affirmations of Jesus' resurrection,  while the gospels describe numerous encounters in detail. Concluded British theologian Michael Green, "The appearances of Jesus are as well authenticated as anything in antiquity... There can be no rational doubt that they occurred."
  </p>
  <h2>
   ARE THERE ANY SUPPORTING FACTS THAT POINT TO
  </h2>
  <h2>
   THE RESURRECTION?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   J. P. Moreland's circumstantial evidence added final documentation for the Resurrection. First, the disciples were in a unique position to know whether the Resurrection happened, and they went to their deaths proclaiming it was true. Nobody knowingly and willingly dies for a lie. Second, apart from the Resurrection, there's no good reason why skeptics like Paul and James would have been converted and would have died for their faith. Third, within weeks of the Crucifixion,  thousands of Jews began abandoning key social practices that had critical sociological and religious importance for centuries. They believed they risked damnation if they were wrong. Fourth, the early sacraments of Communion and baptism affirmed Jesus' resurrection and deity. And fifth, the miraculous emergence of the cburch in the face of brutal Roman persecution "rips a great hole in history, a hole the size and shape of Resurrection," as C. F. D. Moule put it. FAILING MULLER?S CHALLENGE I'll admit it: I was ambushed by the amount and quality of the evidence  that Jesus is the unique Son of God. As I sat at my desk that Sunday afternoon, I shook my head in amazement. I had seen defendants  carted off to the death chamber on much less convincing proof! The cumulative facts and data pointed unmistakably toward a conclusion  that I wasn't entirely comfortable in reaching. Frankly, I had wanted to believe that the deification of Jesus was the result of legendary development in which well-meaning but misguided  people slowly turned a wise sage into the mythological Son of God. That seemed safe and reassuring; after all, a roving apocalyptic preacher from the first century could make no demands on me. But while I went into my investigation thinking that this legendary explanation was intuitively obvious, I emerged convinced it was totally without basis. What clinched it for me was the famous study by A. N. SherwinWhite,  the great classical historian from Oxford University, which William lane Craig alluded to in our interview. Sherwin-White meticulously  examined the rate at which legend accrued in the ancient world. His conclusion: not even two full generations was enough time for legend to develop and to wipe out a solid core of historical truth. Now consider the case of Jesus. Historically speaking, the news of his empty tomb, the eyewitness accounts of his post-Resurrection appearances, and the conviction that he was indeed God's unique Son emerged virtually instantaneously. The I Corinthians 15 creed, affirming Jesus' death for our sins and listing his post-Resurrection appearances to named eyewitnesses, was already being recited by Christians as soon as twenty-four months after the Crucifixion. Mark's account of the empty tomb was drawn from material that dates back to within a few years of the event itself The gospels, attesting to Jesus' teachings, miracles, and resurrection,  were circulating within the lifetimes of Jesus' contemporaries, who would have been only too glad to set the record straight if there had been embellishment or falsehood. The most primitive Christian hymns affirm Jesus' divine nature. Blomberg summed it up this way: "Within the first two years after his death, then, significant numbers of Jesus' followers seem to have formulated a doctrine of the atonement, were convinced that he had been raised from the dead in bodily form, associated Jesus with God, and believed they found support for all these convictions in the Old Testament  ." Concluded William Lane Craig, "The time span necessary for significant  accrual of legend concerning the events of the gospels would place us in the second century A.D.Just the time in fact when the legendary  apocryphal gospels were born. These are the legendary accounts sought by the critics." There was simply nowhere near enough time for mythology to thoroughly corrupt the historical record of Jesus, especially in the midst of eyewitnesses who still had personal knowledge of him. When German theologian Julius Maller in 1844 challenged anyone to find a single example of legend developing that fast anywhere in history, the response from the scholars of his day- and to the present time was  resounding silence  . On November 8, 1981, I realized that my biggest objection to Jesus also had been quieted by the evidence of history. I found myself chuckling at how the tables had been turned. In light of the convincing facts I had learned during my investigation,  in the face of this overwhelming avalanche of evidence in the case for Christ, the great irony was this: it would require much more faith for me to maintain my atheism than to trust in Jesus of Nazareth! IMPLICATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE Remember the story of James Dixon in the introduction of this book? The evidence pointed powerfully toward his guilt for shooting a Chicago police sergeant. He even admitted he did it! Yet when a more thorough investigation was conducted, suddenly a shift occurred: the scenario that fit the facts most perfectly was that the sergeant had framed Dixon, who was innocent of the shooting. Dixon was set free, and it was the officer who found himself convicted. As we conclude our investigation in the case for Christ, it's worth revisiting the two big lessons from that story. First, Has the Collection of Evidence Really Been Thorough? Yes, it has been. I selected experts who could state their position and defend it with historical evidence that I could then test through cross-examination. I wasn't merely interested in their opinions; I wanted facts. I challenged them with the current theories of atheists and liberal professors. Given their background, credentials, experience,  and character, these scholars were more than qualified to present  reliable historical data concerning Jesus.
