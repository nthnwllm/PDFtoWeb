  <p>
   relationship between a child and his father," Witherington
  </p>
  <p>
   explained. "Interestingly, it's also the term disciples used for
  </p>
  <p>
   a beloved teacher in early Judaism. But Jesus used it of God-and
  </p>
  <p>
   as far as I can tell, he and his followers were the only ones
  </p>
  <p>
   praying to God that way."
  </p>
  <p>
   When I asked Witherington to expand on the importance of this, he
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "In the context in which Jesus operated, it was customary
  </p>
  <p>
   for Jews to work around having to say the name of God. His name
  </p>
  <p>
   was the most holy word you could speak, and they even feared
  </p>
  <p>
   mispronouncing  it. If they were going to address God, they might
  </p>
  <p>
   say something like, 'The Holy One, blessed be he,' but they were
  </p>
  <p>
   not going to use his personal name."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And 'Abba' is a personal term," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Very personal," he replied. "It's the term of endearment in
  </p>
  <p>
   which a child would say to a parent, 'Father Dearest, what would
  </p>
  <p>
   you have me do?'"
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   However, I spotted an apparent inconsistency. "Wait a second," I
  </p>
  <p>
   interjected. "Praying 'Abba' must not imply that Jesus thinks
  </p>
  <p>
   he's God, because he taught his disciples to use the same term in
  </p>
  <p>
   their own prayers, and they're not God."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Actually," came Witherington's reply, "the significance of
  </p>
  <p>
   'Abba' is that Jesus is the initiator of an intimate relationship
  </p>
  <p>
   that was previously  unavailable. The question is, What kind of
  </p>
  <p>
   person can change the terms of relating to God? What kind of
  </p>
  <p>
   person can initiate a new covenental relationship with God?"
  </p>
  <p>
   His distinction made sense to me. "So how significant do you
  </p>
  <p>
   consider  Jesus' use of 'Abba' to be?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Quite significant," he answered. "It implies that Jesus had a
  </p>
  <p>
   degree of intimacy with God that is unlike anything in the
  </p>
  <p>
   Judaism of his day. And listen, here's the kicker: Jesus is
  </p>
  <p>
   saying that only through having a relationship with him does this
  </p>
  <p>
   kind of prayer language - this  kind of 'Abba' relationship with
  </p>
  <p>
   God-become possible. That says volumes about how he regarded
  </p>
  <p>
   himself."
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington started to add another important clue-Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   repeated reference to himself as the "Son of Man"-but I let him
  </p>
  <p>
   know that a previous experts Craig Blomberg, had already
  </p>
  <p>
   explained that this was a reference to Daniel 7. This term,
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington agreed, is extremely important in revealing Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   messianic or transcendent self-understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
   At this point I paused to take stock of what Witherington had
  </p>
  <p>
   said. When I put together the clues from Jesus' relationships,
  </p>
  <p>
   miracles,  and words, his perception of his identity came into
  </p>
  <p>
   sharp focus. There seemed little question, based upon the
  </p>
  <p>
   earliest evidence, that Jesus considered himself to be more than
  </p>
  <p>
   a doer of great deeds, more than a teacher, more than another
  </p>
  <p>
   prophet in a line of many. There was ample evidence to conclude
  </p>
  <p>
   that he thought of himself in unique and supreme terms-but
  </p>
  <p>
   exactly how sweeping was this selfunderstanding?
  </p>
  <h2>
   JOHN'S PORTRAIT OF JESUS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   In its opening scene the gospel of John uses majestic and
  </p>
  <p>
   unambiguous  language to boldly assert the deity of Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
  </p>
  <p>
   and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through him all things were made; without him nothing was
  </p>
  <p>
   made that has been made.... The Word became flesh and
  </p>
  <p>
   made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of
  </p>
  <p>
   the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and
  </p>
  <p>
   truth.
  </p>
  <p>
   John 1: 1 -3, 14
  </p>
  <p>
   I remember reading that regal introduction when I went through
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospel of John for the first time. I recall asking myself, I
  </p>
  <p>
   wonder how Jesus would respond if he were to read John's words
  </p>
  <p>
   about him? Would he recoil and say, "Whoa, John has got me all
  </p>
  <p>
   wrong! He has embellished and mythologized me to the point where
  </p>
  <p>
   I don't even recognize  myself"? Or would he nod approvingly and
  </p>
  <p>
   say, "Yep, I'm all that-and more"?
  </p>
  <p>
   Later I encountered the words of scholar Raymond Brown, who had
  </p>
  <p>
   come to his own conclusion: "I have no difficulty with the thesis
  </p>
  <p>
   that if Jesus ... could have read John he would have found that
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel a suitable expression of his identity."
  </p>
  <p>
   Now here was my chance to hear directly from Witherington, who
  </p>
  <p>
   has spent a lifetime analyzing the scholarly minutiae concerning
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' self-perception, about whether he agrees with Brown's
  </p>
  <p>
   assessment. There was no hesitation and no equivocation. "Yes, I
  </p>
  <p>
   do," he said. "I don't have a problem with that. When you're
  </p>
  <p>
   dealing with the gospel of John, you're dealing with a somewhat
  </p>
  <p>
   interpreted picture of Jesus, but I also believe it's a logical
  </p>
  <p>
   drawing out of what was implicit in the historical Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
   And I'll add this: even if you eliminate the gospel of John,
  </p>
  <p>
   there's still no non-messianic Jesus to be conjured up out of the
  </p>
  <p>
   material in the other three gospels. It's just not there."
  </p>
  <p>
   Immediately I thought of the famous exchange, recorded it,
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew, in which Jesus asked his disciples in a private meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Who do you say I am?" Peter replied with clarity, "You are the
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ, the Son of the living God." Instead of ducking the issue,
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus affirmed Peter for his observation. "Blessed are you," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father
  </p>
  <p>
   in heaven." (See Matt. 16:15-17.)
  </p>
  <p>
   Even so, some popular depictions of Jesus, such as in the movie
  </p>
  <p>
   The Last Temptation of Christ, show him as basically uncertain
  </p>
  <p>
   about his identity and mission. He's saddled with ambiguity and
  </p>
  <p>
   angst.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Is there any evidence," I asked Witherington, "that Jesus ever
  </p>
  <p>
   had an identity crisis?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Not an identity crisis, although I do believe he had points of
  </p>
  <p>
   identity confirmation," the professor replied. "At his baptism,
  </p>
  <p>
   at his temptation, at the Transfiguration, in the Garden of
  </p>
  <p>
   Gethsemane - these  are crisis moments in which God confirmed to
  </p>
  <p>
   him who he was and what his mission was.
  </p>
  <p>
   For instance, I don't think it's accidental that his ministry
  </p>
  <p>
   does not begin in earnest until after his baptism, when he hears
  </p>
  <p>
   the voice saying, 'You are my Son, with whom I am well pleased.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   "What did he think his mission was?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "He saw his job as coming to free the people of God, so his
  </p>
  <p>
   mission  was directed to Israel."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Specifically to Israel," I stressed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, that's correct," Witherington said. "There's very little
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence  that he sought out Gentiles during his ministry-that
  </p>
  <p>
   was a mission for the later church. You see, the promises of the
  </p>
  <p>
   prophets had come to Israel-and to Israel he must go."
  </p>
  <p>
   "I AND THE FATHER ARE ONE"
  </p>
  <p>
   In his book Reasonable Faith William Lane Craig points to a
  </p>
  <p>
   substantial  amount of evidence that within twenty years of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Crucifixion  there was a full-blown Christology proclaiming Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   as God incarnate.
  </p>
  <p>
   Church historian Jaroslav Pelikan has pointed out that the oldest
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian sermon, the oldest account of a Christian martyr, the
  </p>
  <p>
   oldest pagan report of the church, and the oldest liturgical
  </p>
  <p>
   prayer (1 Cor. 16:22) all refer to Jesus as Lord and God. Pelikan
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "Clearly, it was the message of what the church believed
  </p>
  <p>
   and taught that 'God' was an appropriate name for Jesus Christ.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   In light of this, I asked Witherington, "Do you see any possible
  </p>
  <p>
   way this could have developed-especially so soon-if Jesus had
  </p>
  <p>
   never made transcendent and messianic claims about himself?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington was adamant. "Not unless you're prepared to argue
  </p>
  <p>
   that the disciples completely forgot what the historical Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   was like and that they had nothing to do with the traditions that
  </p>
  <p>
   start showing up twenty years after his death," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Frankly, as a historian. this would not make any sense at all."
  </p>
  <p>
   In dealing with history, he added, all sorts of things are
  </p>
  <p>
   possible, but not all possible things are equally probable.
  </p>
  <p>
   Is it probable," he asked, "that all this stuff was conjured up
  </p>
  <p>
   out of thin air within twenty years after Jesus died, when there
  </p>
  <p>
   were still living witnesses to what Jesus the historical figure
  </p>
  <p>
   was really like? I find that just about as unlikely a historical
  </p>
  <p>
   hypothesis as you could possibly come up with.
  </p>
  <p>
   The real issue is, what happened after the crucifixion of Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   that changed the minds of the disciples, who had denied,
  </p>
  <p>
   disobeyed, and deserted Jesus? Very simply, something happened to
  </p>
  <p>
   them that was similar to what Jesus experienced at his baptism-it
  </p>
  <p>
   was confirmed  to them that what they had hoped Jesus was, he
  </p>
  <p>
   was."
  </p>
  <p>
   And what exactly was he? As I was wrapping up my time with
  </p>
  <p>
   Witherington, I wanted him to sum it up for me. Taking all his
  </p>
  <p>
   research into consideration, what was his personal conclusion
  </p>
  <p>
   about who Jesus saw himself to be? I posed the question, sat
  </p>
  <p>
   back, and let him spell it out-which he did, with eloquence and
  </p>
  <p>
   conviction. "Jesus thought he was the person appointed by God to
  </p>
  <p>
   bring in the climactic saving act of God in human history. He
  </p>
  <p>
   believed he was the agent of God to carry that out-that he had
  </p>
  <p>
   been authorized by God, empowered by God, he spoke for God, and
  </p>
  <p>
   he was directed by God to do this task. So what Jesus said, God
  </p>
  <p>
   said. What Jesus did was the work of God.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the Jewish concept of agency, 'a man's agent is as himself.
  </p>
  <p>
   Remember how Jesus sent out his apostles and said, 'Whatever they
  </p>
  <p>
   do to you, they've done to me'? There was a strong connection
  </p>
  <p>
   between a man and his agent whom he sends on a mission.
  </p>
  <p>
   Well, Jesus believed he was on a divine mission, and the mission
  </p>
  <p>
   was to redeem the people of God. The implication is that the
  </p>
  <p>
   people of God were lost and that God had to do something-as he
  </p>
  <p>
   had always done-to intervene and set them back on the right
  </p>
  <p>
   track. But there was a difference this time. This was the last
  </p>
  <p>
   time. This was the last chance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Did Jesus believe he was the Son of God, the anointed one of God?
  </p>
  <p>
   The answer is yes. Did he see himself as the Son of Man? The
  </p>
  <p>
   answer is yes. Did he see himself as the final Messiah? Yes,
  </p>
  <p>
   that's the way he viewed himself Did he believe that anybody less
  </p>
  <p>
   than God could save the world? No, I don't believe he did.
  </p>
  <p>
   And here's where the paradox gets as quizzical as it can possibly
  </p>
  <p>
   get: the way God was going to save the world was by his Son
  </p>
  <p>
   dying. The most human of all human acts-to die.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, God, in his divine nature, doesn't die. So how was God going
  </p>
  <p>
   to get this done? How was God going to be the Savior of the human
  </p>
  <p>
   race? He had to come as a human being to accomplish that task.
  </p>
  <p>
   And Jesus believed he was the one to do it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus said in Mark 10:45, 'I did not come to be served but to
  </p>
  <p>
   serve and give my life as a ransom in place of the many.' This is
  </p>
  <p>
   either the highest form of megalomania or it's the example of
  </p>
  <p>
   somebody who really believes, as he said, 'I and the Father are
  </p>
  <p>
   one.' In other words, 'I have the authority to speak for the
  </p>
  <p>
   Father; I have the power to act for the Father; if you reject me,
  </p>
  <p>
   you've rejected the Father.' Even if you eliminated the fourth
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel and just read the synoptics,  this would still be the
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusion you would come to. And it is the conclusion that Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   would have led us to if we had a Bible study and asked him this
  </p>
  <p>
   question.
  </p>
  <p>
   We have to ask, Why is there no other first-century Jew who has
  </p>
  <p>
   millions of followers today? Why isn't there a John the Baptist
  </p>
  <p>
   movement?  Why, of all first-century figures, including the Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   emperors,  is Jesus still worshiped today, while the others have
  </p>
  <p>
   crumbled into the dust of history?
  </p>
  <p>
   It's because this Jesus-the historical Jesus-is also the living
  </p>
  <p>
   Lord. That's why. It's because he's still around, while the
  </p>
  <p>
   others are long gone."

   Like Witherington, many other scholars have painstakingly picked
  </p>
  <p>
   apart the earliest evidence for Jesus and reached the same
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusions. Wrote Craig, "Here is a man who thought of himself
  </p>
  <p>
   as the Son of God in a unique sense, who claimed to act and speak
  </p>
  <p>
   with divine authority, who held himself to be a worker of
