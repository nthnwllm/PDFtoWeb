  <p>
   absolutely remarkable that the chief witnesses to the empty tomb
  </p>
  <p>
   are these women who were friends of Jesus. Any later legendary
  </p>
  <p>
   account would have certainly portrayed male disciples a
  </p>
  <p>
   discovering the tomb-Peter or John, for example. The fact that
  </p>
  <p>
   women are the first witnesses to the empty tomb is most plausibly
  </p>
  <p>
   explained by the reality that-like it or not-they were the
  </p>
  <p>
   discoverers  of the empty tomb! This shows that the gospel
  </p>
  <p>
   writers faithfully recorded what happened, even if it was
  </p>
  <p>
   embarrassing. This bespeaks the historicity of this tradition
  </p>
  <p>
   rather than its legendary status."
  </p>
  <h2>
   WHY DID THE WOMEN VISIT THE TOMB?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Craig's explanation, however, left yet another question
  </p>
  <p>
   lingering: why were the women going to anoint the body of Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   if they already knew that his tomb was securely sealed? "Do their
  </p>
  <p>
   actions really make sense?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig thought for a moment before he answered-this time not in
  </p>
  <p>
   his debater's voice but in a more tender tone. "Lee, I strongly
  </p>
  <p>
   feel that scholars who have not known the love and devotion that
  </p>
  <p>
   these women felt for Jesus have no right to pronounce cool
  </p>
  <p>
   judgments upon the feasibility of what they wanted to do.
  </p>
  <p>
   For people who are grieving, who have lost someone they
  </p>
  <p>
   desperately  loved and followed, to want to go to the tomb in a
  </p>
  <p>
   forlorn hope of anointing the body-I just don't think some later
  </p>
  <p>
   critic can treat them like robots and say, 'They shouldn't have
  </p>
  <p>
   gone."'
  </p>
  <p>
   He shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe they thought there would be men
  </p>
  <p>
   around who could move the stone. If there were guards, maybe they
  </p>
  <p>
   thought they would. I don't know.
  </p>
  <p>
   Certainly the notion of visiting a tomb to pour oils over a body
  </p>
  <p>
   is a historical Jewish practice; the only question is the
  </p>
  <p>
   feasibility of who would move the stone for them. And I don't
  </p>
  <p>
   think we're in the right position to pronounce judgment on
  </p>
  <p>
   whether or not they should have simply stayed at home."
  </p>
  <h2>
   WHY DIDN'T CHRISTIANS CITE THE EMPTY TOMB?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   In preparing for my interview with Craig, I had gone to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Internet sites of several atheist organizations to see the kind
  </p>
  <p>
   of arguments they were raising against the Resurrection. For some
  </p>
  <p>
   reason few atheists deal with this topic. However, one critic
  </p>
  <p>
   raised an objection that I wanted to present to Craig.
  </p>
  <p>
   Essentially, he said a major argument against the empty tomb is
  </p>
  <p>
   that none of the disciples or later Christian preachers bothered
  </p>
  <p>
   to point to it. He wrote, "We would expect the early Christian
  </p>
  <p>
   preachers to have said: 'You don't believe us? Go look in the
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb yourselves! It's at the corner of Fifth and Main, third
  </p>
  <p>
   sepulcher on the right."'
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet, he said, Peter doesn't mention the empty tomb in his
  </p>
  <p>
   preaching  in Acts 2. Concluded this critic, "If even the
  </p>
  <p>
   disciples didn't think the empty tomb tradition was any good, why
  </p>
  <p>
   should we?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig's eyes widened as I posed the question. "I just don't think
  </p>
  <p>
   that's true," he replied, a bit of astonishment in his voice, as
  </p>
  <p>
   he picked up his Bible and turned to the second chapter of Acts.
  </p>
  <p>
   which records Peter's sermon at Pentecost.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The empty tomb is found in Peter's speech," Craig insisted. "He
  </p>
  <p>
   proclaims in verse 24 that 'God raised him from the dead, freeing
  </p>
  <p>
   him from the agony of death.'
  </p>
  <p>
   Then he quotes from a psalm about how God would not allow
  </p>
  <p>
   his Holy One to undergo decay. This had been written by David,
  </p>
  <p>
   and Peter says, 'I can tell you confidently that the patriarch
  </p>
  <p>
   David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.'
  </p>
  <p>
   But, he says, Christ 'was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his
  </p>
  <p>
   body see decay. God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses of the fact.'" Craig looked up from the Bible. "This
  </p>
  <p>
   speech contrasts David's tomb, which remained to that day, with
  </p>
  <p>
   the prophecy in which David says Christ would be raised up-his
  </p>
  <p>
   flesh wouldn't suffer decay. It's, clearly implicit that the tomb
  </p>
  <p>
   was left empty."
  </p>
  <p>
   Then he turned to a later chapter in the book of Acts. "In Acts
  </p>
  <p>
   13:29-31, Paul says, 'When they had carried out all that was
  </p>
  <p>
   written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him
  </p>
  <p>
   in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead, and for many days he
  </p>
  <p>
   was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to
  </p>
  <p>
   Jerusalem.' Certainly the empty tomb is implicit there."
  </p>
  <p>
   He shut his Bible, then added, "I think it's rather wooden and
  </p>
  <p>
   unreasonable to contend that these early preachers didn't refer
  </p>
  <p>
   to the empty tomb, just because they didn't use the two specific
  </p>
  <p>
   words empty tomb. There's no question that they knew-and their
  </p>
  <p>
   audiences understood from their preaching-that Jesus' tomb was
  </p>
  <p>
   vacant."
  </p>
  <h2>
   WHAT'S THE AFFIRMATIVE EVIDENCE?
  </h2>
  <p>
   I had spent the first part of our interview peppering Craig with
  </p>
  <p>
   objections and arguments challenging the empty tomb. But I
  </p>
  <p>
   suddenly realized that I hadn't given him the opportunity to
  </p>
  <p>
   spell out his affirmative case. While he had already alluded to
  </p>
  <p>
   several reasons why he believes Jesus' tomb was unoccupied, I
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "Why don't you give me, your best shot? Convince me with
  </p>
  <p>
   your top four or five reasons that the empty tomb is a historical
  </p>
  <p>
   fact."
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig rose to the challenge. One by one he spelled out his
  </p>
  <p>
   arguments  concisely and powerfully.
  </p>
  <p>
   "First," he said, "the empty tomb is definitely implicit in the
  </p>
  <p>
   early tradition that is passed along by Paul in I Corinthians 15,
  </p>
  <p>
   which is a very old and reliable source of historical information
  </p>
  <p>
   about Jesus. Second, the site of Jesus' tomb was known to
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian and Jew alike. So if it weren't empty, it would be
  </p>
  <p>
   impossible for a movement founded on belief in the Resurrection
  </p>
  <p>
   to have come into existence in the same city where this man had
  </p>
  <p>
   been publicly executed and buried. Third, we can tell from the
  </p>
  <p>
   language, grammar, and style that Mark got his empty tomb story-
  </p>
  <p>
   actually, his whole passion narrative-from  an earlier source. In
  </p>
  <p>
   fact, there's evidence it was written before A.D. 37, which is
  </p>
  <p>
   much too early for legend to have seriously corrupted it.
  </p>
  <p>
   A.N. Sherwin-White, the respected Greco-Roman classical historian
  </p>
  <p>
   from Oxford University, said it would have been without precedent
  </p>
  <p>
   anywhere in history for legend to have grown up that fast and
  </p>
  <p>
   significantly distorted the gospels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fourth, there's the simplicity of the empty tomb story in Mark.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fictional apocryphal accounts from the second century contain all
  </p>
  <p>
   kinds of flowery narratives, in which Jesus comes out of the tomb
  </p>
  <p>
   in glory and power, with everybody seeing him, including the
  </p>
  <p>
   priests, Jewish authorities, and Roman guards. Those are the way
  </p>
  <p>
   legends read, but these don't come until generations after the
  </p>
  <p>
   events, which is after eyewitnesses have died off. By contrast,
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark's account of the story of the empty tomb is stark in its
  </p>
  <p>
   simplicity and unadorned by theological reflection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fifth, the unanimous testimony that the empty tomb was discovered
  </p>
  <p>
   by women argues for the authenticity of the story, because this
  </p>
  <p>
   would have been embarrassing for the disciples to admit and most
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly would have been covered up if this were a legend.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sixth, the earliest Jewish polemic presupposes the historicity of
  </p>
  <p>
   the empty tomb. In other words, there was nobody who was claiming
  </p>
  <p>
   that the tomb still contained Jesus' body. The question always
  </p>
  <p>
   was, 'What happened to the body?'
  </p>
  <p>
   The Jews proposed the ridiculous story that the guards had
  </p>
  <p>
   fallen asleep. Obviously, they were grasping at straws. But the
  </p>
  <p>
   point is this: they started with the assumption that the tomb was
  </p>
  <p>
   vacant! Why? Because they knew it was!"
  </p>
  <h2>
   WHAT ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THEORIES?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I listened intently as Craig articulated each point, and to me
  </p>
  <p>
   the six arguments added up to an impressive case. However, I
  </p>
  <p>
   still wanted to see if there were any loopholes before concluding
  </p>
  <p>
   it was airtight. "Kirsopp Lake suggested in 1907 that the women
  </p>
  <p>
   merely went to the wrong tomb," I said. "He says they got lost
  </p>
  <p>
   and a caretaker at an unoccupied tomb told them, 'You're looking
  </p>
  <p>
   for Jesus of Nazareth. He is not here,' and they ran away,
  </p>
  <p>
   afraid. Isn't that a plausible explanation?"' Craig sighed. "Lake
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't generate any following with this," he said. "The reason is
  </p>
  <p>
   that the site of Jesus' tomb was known to the Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   authorities. Even if the women had made this mistake, the
  </p>
  <p>
   authorities  would have been only too happy to point out the tomb
  </p>
  <p>
   and correct the disciples' error when they began to proclaim that
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus had risen from the dead. I don't know anybody who holds to
  </p>
  <p>
   Lake's theory today." Frankly, other options didn't sound very
  </p>
  <p>
   likely, either. Obviously, the disciples had no motive to steal
  </p>
  <p>
   the body and then die for a lie, and certainly the Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   authorities wouldn't have removed the body. I said, "We're left
  </p>
  <p>
   with the theory that the empty tomb was a later legend  and that
  </p>
  <p>
   by the time it developed, people were unable to disprove it,
  </p>
  <p>
   because the location of the tomb had been forgotten."
  </p>
  <p>
   "That has been the issue ever since 1835, when David Strauss
  </p>
  <p>
   claimed these stories are legendary," Craig replied. "And that's
  </p>
  <p>
   why in our conversation today we've focused so much on this
  </p>
  <p>
   legendary hypothesis by showing that the empty tomb story goes
  </p>
  <p>
   back to within a few years of the events themselves. This renders
  </p>
  <p>
   the legend theory worthless. Even if there are some legendary
  </p>
  <p>
   elements in the secondary  details of the story, the historical
  </p>
  <p>
   core of the story remains securely established."
  </p>
  <p>
   Yes, there were answers for these alternative explanations. Upon
  </p>
  <p>
   analysis, every theory seemed to crumble under the weight of
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence and logic. But the only remaining option was to believe
  </p>
  <p>
   that the crucified  Jesus returned to life-a conclusion some
  </p>
  <p>
   people find too
  </p>
  <p>
   extraordinary to swallow.
  </p>
  <p>
   I thought for a moment about how I could phrase this in a
  </p>
  <p>
   question  to Craig. Finally I said, "Even though these
  </p>
  <p>
   alternative theories admittedly have holes in them, aren't they
  </p>
  <p>
   more plausible than the absolutely incredible idea that Jesus was
  </p>
  <p>
   God incarnate who was raised from the dead?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "This, I think, is the issue," he said, leaning forward. "I think
  </p>
  <p>
   people who push these alternative theories would admit, 'Yes, our
  </p>
  <p>
   theories  are implausible, but they're not as improbable as the
  </p>
  <p>
   idea that this spectacular miracle occurred.' However, at this
  </p>
  <p>
   point the matter is no longer a historical issue; instead it's a
  </p>
  <p>
   philosophical question about whether miracles are possible."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And what," I asked, "would you say to that?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "I would argue that the hypothesis that God raised Jesus from the
  </p>
  <p>
   dead is not at all improbable. In fact, based on the evidence,
  </p>
  <p>
   it's the best explanation for what happened. What is improbable
  </p>
  <p>
   is the hypothesis that Jesus rose naturally from the dead. That,
  </p>
  <p>
   I would agree, is outlandish. Any hypothesis would be more
  </p>
  <p>
   probable than saying the corpse of Jesus spontaneously came back
  </p>
  <p>
   to life. But the hypothesis that God raised Jesus from the dead
  </p>
  <p>
   doesn't contradict science or any known facts of experience. All
  </p>
  <p>
   it requires is the hypothesis that God exists, and I think there
  </p>
  <p>
   are good independent  reasons for believing that he does."
  </p>
  <p>
   With that Craig added this clincher: "As long as the existence of
  </p>
  <p>
   God is even possible, it's possible that he acted in history by
  </p>
  <p>
   raising Jesus from the dead."
  </p>
  <h2>
   CONCLUSION: THE TOMB WAS VACANT
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Craig was convincing: the empty tomb-admittedly, a miracle of
  </p>
  <p>
   staggering  proportions-did make sense in light of the evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   And it was only part of the case for the Resurrection. From
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig's Atlanta home I was getting ready to go to Virginia to
  </p>
  <p>
   interview a renowned expert on the evidence for the appearances
  </p>
  <p>
   of the resurrected Jesus, and then to California to speak with
  </p>
  <p>
   another scholar about the considerable  circumstantial evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   As I thanked Craig and his wife, Jan, for their hospitality, I
  </p>
  <p>
   reflected to myself that up close, in his blue jeans and white
  </p>
  <p>
   socks, Craig didn't look like the kind of formidable adversary
  </p>
  <p>
   who would devastate the best Resurrection critics in the world.
