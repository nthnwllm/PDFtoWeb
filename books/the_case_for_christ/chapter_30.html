  <p>
   saying,  'Who can forgive sins but God alone?'  To my mind, that
  </p>
  <p>
   is one of the most striking things Jesus did."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Not only did Jesus forgive sin," I observed, "but he asserted
  </p>
  <p>
   that he himself was without sin. And certainly sinlessness is an
  </p>
  <p>
   attribute of deity."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes," he replied. "Historically in the West, people considered
  </p>
  <p>
   most holy have also been the most conscious of their own failures
  </p>
  <p>
   and sins. They are people who are aware of their shortcomings and
  </p>
  <p>
   lusts and resentments, and they're fighting them honestly by the
  </p>
  <p>
   grace of a               God. In fact, they're fighting them so
  </p>
  <p>
   well that others take notice and say, 'There is a holy man or
  </p>
  <p>
   woman.'
  </p>
  <p>
   But along comes Jesus, who can say with a straight face, 'Which
  </p>
  <p>
   of you can convict me of sin?'   If I said that, my wife and
  </p>
  <p>
   children and all who know me would be glad to stand up and
  </p>
  <p>
   testify, whereas no one could with respect to Christ."
  </p>
  <p>
   Although moral perfection and the forgiveness of sin are
  </p>
  <p>
   undoubtedly  characteristics of deity, there are several
  </p>
  <p>
   additional attributes that Jesus must fulfill if he is to match
  </p>
  <p>
   the sketch of God. It was time to progress to those. After having
  </p>
  <p>
   started by lobbing softballs at Carson,  I got ready to throw
  </p>
  <p>
   some curves.
  </p>
  <h2>
   MYSTERY OF THE INCARNATION
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Using some notes I had brought along, I hit Carson in rapid-fire
  </p>
  <p>
   succession  with some of the biggest obstacles to Jesus' claim of
  </p>
  <p>
   deity. "Dr. Carson, how in the world could Jesus be omnipresent
  </p>
  <p>
   if he couldn't be in two places at once?" I asked. "How could he
  </p>
  <p>
   be omniscient  when he says, 'Not even the Son of Man knows the
  </p>
  <p>
   hour of his return'? How could he be omnipotent when the gospels
  </p>
  <p>
   plainly tell us that he was unable to do many miracles in his
  </p>
  <p>
   hometown?" Pointing my pen at him for emphasis, I concluded by
  </p>
  <p>
   saying, "Let's admit it: the Bible itself seems to argue against
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus being God."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   While Carson didn't flinch, he did concede that these questions
  </p>
  <p>
   have no simple answers. After all, they strike at the very heart
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Incarnation-God becoming man, spirit taking on flesh, the
  </p>
  <p>
   infinite becoming finite, the eternal becoming time-bound. It's a
  </p>
  <p>
   doctrine that has kept theologians busy for centuries. And that's
  </p>
  <p>
   where Carson chose to start his answer: by going back to the way
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars have tried to respond to these matters through the
  </p>
  <p>
   years.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Historically, there have been two or three approaches to this,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he began, sounding a bit as if he were beginning a classroom
  </p>
  <p>
   lecture. "For example, at the end of the last century, the great
  </p>
  <p>
   theologian Benjamin Warfield worked through the gospels and
  </p>
  <p>
   ascribed various bits either to Christ's humanity or to his
  </p>
  <p>
   deity. When Jesus does some thing that's a reflection of him
  </p>
  <p>
   being God, that's ascribed to Christ's deity. When there's
  </p>
  <p>
   something reflecting his limitations or finiteness or his
  </p>
  <p>
   humanness-for example, his tears; does God cry?-that's ascribed
  </p>
  <p>
   to his humanity."
  </p>
  <p>
   That explanation was fraught with problems, it seemed to me. "If
  </p>
  <p>
   you do that, wouldn't you end up with a schizophrenic Jesus?" I
  </p>
  <p>
   asked. "It's easy to slip into that unwittingly," he replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   "All the confessional  statements have insisted that both Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   humanity and his deity remained distinct, yet they combined in
  </p>
  <p>
   one person. So you want to avoid a solution in which there are
  </p>
  <p>
   essentially two minds-sort of a Jesus human mind and a Christ
  </p>
  <p>
   heavenly mind. However, this is one kind of solution, and there
  </p>
  <p>
   may be something to it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other kind of solution is some form of kenosis, which means
  </p>
  <p>
   'emptying.' This spins out of Philippians 2, where Paul tells us
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus, 'being in the form of God, did not think equality
  </p>
  <p>
   with God was something to be exploited' - that's the way it
  </p>
  <p>
   should be translated but  emptied himself' He became a nobody."
  </p>
  <p>
   That seemed a little ambiguous to me. "Can you be more
  </p>
  <p>
   explicit?" I asked. "What exactly did he empty himself of?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Apparently, I had put my finger on the issue. "Ah, that's the
  </p>
  <p>
   question,"  Carson replied with a nod. "Through the centuries,
  </p>
  <p>
   people have given various answers to that. For instance, did he
  </p>
  <p>
   empty himself of his deity? Well, then he would no longer be God.
  </p>
  <p>
   Did he empty himself of the attributes of his deity? I have a
  </p>
  <p>
   problem with that too, because it's difficult to separate
  </p>
  <p>
   attributes from reality. If you have an animal that looks like a
  </p>
  <p>
   horse, smells like a horse, walks like a horse, and has all the
  </p>
  <p>
   attributes of a horse, you've got a horse. So I don't know what
  </p>
  <p>
   it means for God to empty himself of his attributes and still be
  </p>
  <p>
   God.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some have said, 'He didn't empty himself of his attributes, but
  </p>
  <p>
   he emptied himself of the use of his attributes'-a self-limiting
  </p>
  <p>
   type of thing. That's getting Closer, although there are times
  </p>
  <p>
   when that was not what he was doing-he was forgiving sins the way
  </p>
  <p>
   only God can, which is an attribute of deity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Others go further by saying, 'He emptied himself of the
  </p>
  <p>
   independent  use of his attributes! That is, he functioned like
  </p>
  <p>
   God when his heavenly Father gave him explicit sanction to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, that's much closer. The difficulty is that there is a sense
  </p>
  <p>
   in which the eternal Son has always acted in line with his
  </p>
  <p>
   Father's commandments. You don't want to lose that, even in
  </p>
  <p>
   eternity past. But it's getting closer." I sensed we were
  </p>
  <p>
   somewhere in the vicinity of the bull's-eye, but I wasn't sure we
  </p>
  <p>
   were going to get much closer. That seemed to be Carsons
  </p>
  <p>
   sentiment, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Strictly speaking," he said, "Philippians 2 does not tell us
  </p>
  <p>
   precisely  what the eternal Son emptied himself of. He emptied
  </p>
  <p>
   himself, he became a nobody. Some kind of emptying is at issue,
  </p>
  <p>
   but let's be frank-you're talking about the Incarnation, one of
  </p>
  <p>
   the central mysteries  of the Christian faith.
  </p>
  <p>
   You're dealing with formless, bodiless, omniscient, omnipresent,
  </p>
  <p>
   omnipotent Spirit and finite, touchable, physical, time-bound
  </p>
  <p>
   creatures. For one to become the other inevitably binds you up in
  </p>
  <p>
   mysteries. So part of Christian theology has been concerned not
  </p>
  <p>
   with
  </p>
  <p>
   explaining it all away' but with trying to take the biblical
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence and, retaining all of it fairly, find ways of synthesis
  </p>
  <p>
   that are rationally coherent, even if they're not exhaustively
  </p>
  <p>
   explanatory."
  </p>
  <p>
   That was a sophisticated way of saying that theologians can come
  </p>
  <p>
   up with explanations that seem to make sense, even though they
  </p>
  <p>
   might not be able to explain every nuance about the Incarnation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a way, that seemed logical. If the Incarnation is true, it's
  </p>
  <p>
   not surprising  that finite minds couldn't totally comprehend it.
  </p>
  <p>
   It seemed to me that some sort of voluntary "emptying" of Jesus'
  </p>
  <p>
   independent use of his attributes was reasonable in explaining
  </p>
  <p>
   why he generally didn't exhibit the "omnis"-omniscience,
  </p>
  <p>
   omnipotence, and omnipresence-in his earthly existence, even
  </p>
  <p>
   though the New Testament  clearly states that all these qualities
  </p>
  <p>
   are ultimately true of him. That, however, was only part of the
  </p>
  <p>
   problem. I flipped to the next page of my   notes and began
  </p>
  <p>
   another line of questioning about some specific biblical passages
  </p>
  <p>
   that seemed to directly contradict Jesus' claim to being God.
  </p>
  <h2>
   CREATOR OR CREATED?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Part of the sketch that Jesus must match is that God is an
  </p>
  <p>
   uncreated being who has existed from eternity past. Isaiah 57:15
  </p>
  <p>
   describes God as "he who lives forever." But, I said to Carson,
  </p>
  <p>
   there are some verses that seem to strongly suggest that Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   was a created being. "For instance," I said, "John 3:16 calls
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus the 'begotten' Son of God, and Colossians 1:15 says he was
  </p>
  <p>
   the 'firstborn over all creation.'  Don't they clearly imply that
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus was created, as opposed to being the Creator?"
  </p>
  <p>
   One of Carson's areas of expertise is Greek grammar, which he
  </p>
  <p>
   called upon in responding to both of those verses.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let's take John 3:16," he said. "It's the King James Version
  </p>
  <p>
   that translates the Greek with the words 'his only begotten Son.'
  </p>
  <p>
   Those who consider this the correct rendering usually bind that
  </p>
  <p>
   up with the Incarnation itself-that is, his begetting in the
  </p>
  <p>
   Virgin Mary. But in fact, that's not what the word in Greek
  </p>
  <p>
   means.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It really means 'unique one.' The way it was usually used in the
  </p>
  <p>
   first century is 'unique and beloved.' So John 3:16 is simply
  </p>
  <p>
   saying that Jesus is the unique and beloved Son-or as the New
  </p>
  <p>
   International  Version translates it, 'the one and only Son'-
  </p>
  <p>
   rather than saying  that he's ontologically begotten in time."
  </p>
  <p>
   "That only explains that one passage," I pointed out.
  </p>
  <p>
   "OK, let's look at the Colossians verse, which uses the term
  </p>
  <p>
   'firstborn.'  The vast majority of commentators, whether
  </p>
  <p>
   conservative or liberal,  recognize that in the Old Testament the
  </p>
  <p>
   firstborn, because of the laws of succession, normally received
  </p>
  <p>
   the lion's share of the estate, or the firstbom would become king
  </p>
  <p>
   in the case of a royal family. The firstborn  therefore was the
  </p>
  <p>
   one ultimately with all the rights of the father. "By the second
  </p>
  <p>
   century before Christ, there are places where the word no longer
  </p>
  <p>
   has any notion of actual begetting or of being born first but
  </p>
  <p>
   carries the idea of the authority that comes with the position of
  </p>
  <p>
   being the rightful heir. That's the way it applies to Jesus, as
  </p>
  <p>
   virtually  all scholars admit. In light of that, the very
  </p>
  <p>
   expression 'firstborn' is slightly misleading."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What would be a better translation?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I think 'supreme heir' would be more appropriate," he responded.
  </p>
  <p>
   While that would explain the Colossians passage, Carson went even
  </p>
  <p>
   further, with one last point.
  </p>
  <p>
   "If you're going to quote Colossians 1:15, you have to keep it in
  </p>
  <p>
   context by going on to Colossians 2:9, where the very same author
  </p>
  <p>
   stresses, 'For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in
  </p>
  <p>
   bodily form.' The author wouldn't contradict himself. So the term
  </p>
  <p>
   'firstborn' cannot exclude Jesus' eternality, since that is part
  </p>
  <p>
   of what it means to possess the fullness of the divine."
  </p>
  <p>
   For me, that nailed the issue. But there were other troubling
  </p>
  <p>
   passages  as well. For example, in Mark 10 someone addresses
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus as "good teacher," promoting him to reply, "Why do you call
  </p>
  <p>
   me good? No one is good-except God alone."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Wasn't he denying his divinity by saying this?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "No, I think he was trying to get the fellow to stop and think
  </p>
  <p>
   about what he was saying," Carson explained. "The parallel
  </p>
  <p>
   passage in Matthew is a little more expansive and does not find
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus downplaying  his deity at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I think all he's saying is, 'Wait a minute; why are you calling
  </p>
  <p>
   me good? Is this just a polite thing, like you say, "Good day"?
  </p>
  <p>
   What do you mean by good? You call me good master-is this because
  </p>
  <p>
   you're trying to honey up to me?'
  </p>
  <p>
   In a fundamental sense there's only one who is good, and that's
  </p>
  <p>
   God. But Jesus is not implicitly saying, 'So don't call me that.'
  </p>
  <p>
   He's saying  Do you really understand what you're saying when you
  </p>
  <p>
   say that? Are you really ascribing to me what should only be
  </p>
  <p>
   ascribed to God?' That could be teased out to mean, 'I really am
  </p>
  <p>
   what you say; you speak better than you know' or 'Don't you dare
  </p>
  <p>
   call me that; next time call me "sinner Jesus" like everybody
  </p>
  <p>
   else does.' In terms of all that Jesus says and does elsewhere,
  </p>
  <p>
   which way does it make sense to take it?"
  </p>
  <p>
   With so many verses that call Jesus "sinless," "holy,"
  </p>
  <p>
   "righteous,"  "innocent   ... .. undefiled," and "separate from
  </p>
  <p>
   sinners," the answer was pretty obvious.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WAS JESUS A LESSER GOD?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   If Jesus was God, what kind of God was he? Was he equal to the
  </p>
  <p>
   Father, or some sort of junior God, possessing the attributes of
  </p>
  <p>
   deity and yet somehow failing to match the total sketch that the
  </p>
  <p>
   Old Testament  provides of the divine?
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   That question comes out of another passage that I pointed out to
  </p>
  <p>
   Carson. "Jesus said in John 14:28, 'The Father is greater than V
