  <p>
   Pliny the Younger became governor of Bithynia in northwestern
  </p>
  <p>
   Turkey. Much of his correspondence with his friend, Emperor
  </p>
  <p>
   Trajan, has been preserved to the present time."
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi pulled out a photocopy of a book page, saying, "In book
  </p>
  <p>
   10 of these letters he specifically refers to the Christians he
  </p>
  <p>
   has arrested."
  </p>
  <p>
   I have asked them if they are Christians, and if they admit it, I
  </p>
  <p>
   repeat the question a second and third time, with a warning of
  </p>
  <p>
   the punishment awaiting them. If they persist, I order them to be
  </p>
  <p>
   led away for execution; for, whatever the nature of their
  </p>
  <p>
   admission, I am convinced that their stubbornness and
  </p>
  <p>
   unshakable obstinacy ought not to go unpunished....
  </p>
  <p>
   They also declared that the sum total of their guilt or error
  </p>
  <p>
   amounted to no more than this: they had met regularly before dawn
  </p>
  <p>
   on a fixed day to chant verses alternately amongst themselves  in
  </p>
  <p>
   honor of Christ as if to a god, and also to bind themselves  by
  </p>
  <p>
   oath, not for any criminal purpose, but to abstain
  </p>
  <p>
   from theft, robbery, and adultery...
  </p>
  <p>
   This made me decide it was all the more necessary to extract the
  </p>
  <p>
   truth by torture from two slave-women, whom they called
  </p>
  <p>
   deaconesses. I found nothing but a degenerate sort of cult
  </p>
  <p>
   carried  to extravagant lengths."
  </p>
  <p>
   "How important is this reference?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Very important. It was probably written about A.D. 111, and it
  </p>
  <p>
   attests to the rapid spread of Christianity, both in the city and
  </p>
  <p>
   in the rural area, among every class of persons, slave women as
  </p>
  <p>
   well as Roman citizens, since he also says that he sends
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians who are Roman citizens to Rome for trial.
  </p>
  <p>
   "And it talks about the worship of Jesus as God, that Christians
  </p>
  <p>
   maintained high ethical standards, and that they were not easily
  </p>
  <p>
   swayed from their beliefs."
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE DAY THE EARTH WENT DARK
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   To me, one of the most problematic references in the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament is where the gospel writers claim that the earth went
  </p>
  <p>
   dark during part of the time that Jesus hung on the cross. Wasn't
  </p>
  <p>
   this merely a literary device to stress the significance of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Crucifixion, and not a reference  to an actual historical
  </p>
  <p>
   occurrence? After all, if darkness had fallen over the earth,
  </p>
  <p>
   wouldn't there be at least some mention of this extraordinary
  </p>
  <p>
   event outside the Bible?
  </p>
  <p>
   However, Dr. Gary Habermas, has written about a historian named
  </p>
  <p>
   Thallus who in A.D. 52 wrote a history of the eastern
  </p>
  <p>
   Mediterranean world since the Trojan War. Although Thallus's work
  </p>
  <p>
   has been lost, it was quoted by Julius Africanus in about A.D.
  </p>
  <p>
   221-and it made reference  to the darkness that the gospels had
  </p>
  <p>
   written about!
  </p>
  <p>
   "Could this," I asked, "be independent corroboration of this
  </p>
  <p>
   biblical  claim?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Explained Yamauchi, "In this passage Julius Africanus says,
  </p>
  <p>
   'Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away the
  </p>
  <p>
   darkness as an eclipse of the sun-unreasonably, as it seems to
  </p>
  <p>
   me.'
  </p>
  <p>
   "So Thallus apparently was saying yes, there had been darkness at
  </p>
  <p>
   the time of the Crucifixion, and he speculated it had been caused
  </p>
  <p>
   by an eclipse. Africanus then argues that it couldn't have been
  </p>
  <p>
   an eclipse, given when the Crucifixion occurred."
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi reached over to his desk to retrieve a piece of paper.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me quote what scholar Paul Maier said about the darkness in
  </p>
  <p>
   a footnote in his 1968 book Pontius Pilate," he said, reading
  </p>
  <p>
   these words:
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   This phenomenon, evidently, was visible in Rome, Athens, and
  </p>
  <p>
   other Mediterranean cities. According to Tertullian ... it was a
  </p>
  <p>
   "cosmic" or "world event." Phlegon, a Greek author from
  </p>
  <p>
   Caria writing a chronology soon after 137 A.D., reported that in
  </p>
  <p>
   the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad (i.e., 33 A.D.) there was
  </p>
  <p>
   "the greatest eclipse of the sun" and that "it became night in
  </p>
  <p>
   the sixth hour of the day [i.e., noon] so that stars even
  </p>
  <p>
   appeared in the heavens. There was a great earthquake in
  </p>
  <p>
   Bithynia, and many things were overturned in Nicaea."
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi concluded, "So there is, as Paul Maier points out,
  </p>
  <p>
   nonbiblical  attestation of the darkness that occurred at the
  </p>
  <p>
   time of Jesus' crucifixion. Apparently, some found the need to
  </p>
  <p>
   try to give it a natural explanation by saying it was an
  </p>
  <p>
   eclipse."
  </p>
  <h2>
   A PORTRAIT OF PILATE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Yamauchi's mentioning of Pilate reminded me of how some critics
  </p>
  <p>
   have questioned the accuracy of the gospels because of the way
  </p>
  <p>
   they portray this Roman leader. While the New Testament paints
  </p>
  <p>
   him as being vacillating and willing to yield to the pressures of
  </p>
  <p>
   a Jewish mob by executing Jesus, other historical accounts
  </p>
  <p>
   picture him as being obstinate and inflexible.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Doesn't this represent a contradiction between the Bible and
  </p>
  <p>
   secular historians?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "No, it really doesn't," said Yamauchi. "Maier's study of Pilate
  </p>
  <p>
   shows that his protector or patron was Sejanus and that Sejanus
  </p>
  <p>
   fell from power in A.D. 31 because he was plotting against the
  </p>
  <p>
   emperor." I was puzzled. "What does that have to do with
  </p>
  <p>
   anything?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, this loss would have made Pilate's position very weak in
  </p>
  <p>
   A.D. 33, which is most likely when Jesus was crucified," the
  </p>
  <p>
   professor  responded. "So it would certainly be understandable
  </p>
  <p>
   that Pilate would have been reluctant to offend the Jews at that
  </p>
  <p>
   time and to get into further trouble with the emperor. That means
  </p>
  <p>
   the biblical description is most likely correct."
  </p>
  <h2>
   OTHER JEWISH ACCOUNTS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Having talked primarily about Roman corroboration of Jesus, I
  </p>
  <p>
   wanted to turn a corner at this point and discuss whether any
  </p>
  <p>
   other Jewish accounts besides that of Josephus verify anything
  </p>
  <p>
   about Jesus. I asked Yamauchi about references to Jesus in the
  </p>
  <p>
   Talmud, an important  Jewish work finished about A.D. 500 that
  </p>
  <p>
   incorporates the Mishnah,  compiled about A.D. 200.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Jews, as a whole, did not go into great detail about heretics,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he replied. "There are a few passages in the Talmud that mention
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, calling him a false messiah who practiced magic and who
  </p>
  <p>
   was justly condemned to death. They also repeat the rumor that
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus was born of a Roman soldier and Mary, suggesting there was
  </p>
  <p>
   something unusual about his birth."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So," I said, "in a negative way these Jewish references do
  </p>
  <p>
   corroborate  some things about Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, that's right," he said. "Professor M. Wilcox put it this
  </p>
  <p>
   way in an article that appeared in a scholarly reference work:
  </p>
  <p>
   'The Jewish traditional literature, although it mentions Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   only quite sparingly (and must in any case be used with caution),
  </p>
  <p>
   supports the gospel claim that he was a healer and miracle-
  </p>
  <p>
   worker,  even though it ascribes these activities to sorcery.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, it preserves the recollection that he was a teacher,
  </p>
  <p>
   and that he had disciples (five of them), and that at least in
  </p>
  <p>
   the earlier Rabbinic period not all of the sages had finally made
  </p>
  <p>
   up their minds that he was a "heretic" or a "deceiver.'
  </p>
  <h2>
   EVIDENCE APART FROM THE BIBLE
  </h2>
  <p>
   Although we were finding quite a few references to Jesus outside
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospels, I was wondering why there were not even more of
  </p>
  <p>
   them. While I knew that few historical documents from the first
  </p>
  <p>
   century have survived, I asked, "Overall, shouldn't we have
  </p>
  <p>
   expected to find more about Jesus in ancient writings outside the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "When people begin religious movements, it's often not until many
  </p>
  <p>
   generations later that people record things about them," Yamauchi
  </p>
  <p>
   said. "But the fact is that we have better historical
  </p>
  <p>
   documentation for Jesus than for the founder of any other ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   religion."
  </p>
  <p>
   That caught me off guard. "Really?" I said. "Can you elaborate on
  </p>
  <p>
   that?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "For example, although the Gathas of Zoroaster, about 1000 B.C.,
  </p>
  <p>
   are believed to be authentic, most of the Zoroastrian scriptures
  </p>
  <p>
   were not put into writing until after the third century A.D. The
  </p>
  <p>
   most popular  Parsi biography of Zoroaster was written in A.D.
  </p>
  <p>
   1278.
  </p>
  <p>
   The scriptures of Buddha, who lived in the sixth century B.C.,
  </p>
  <p>
   were not put into writing until after the Christian era,
  </p>
  <p>
   and the first biography of Buddha was written in the first
  </p>
  <p>
   century A.D. Although we have the sayings of Muhammad, who lived
  </p>
  <p>
   from A.D. 570 to 632, in the Koran, his biography was not written
  </p>
  <p>
   until 767-more than a full century after his death.
  </p>
  <p>
   So the situation with Jesus is unique-and quite impressive in
  </p>
  <p>
   terms of how much we can learn about him aside from the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I wanted to pick up on that theme and summarize what we had
  </p>
  <p>
   gleaned about Jesus so far from nonbiblical sources. "Let's
  </p>
  <p>
   pretend we didn't have any of the New Testament or other
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian writings," I said. "Even without them, what would we be
  </p>
  <p>
   able to conclude about Jesus from ancient non-Christian sources,
  </p>
  <p>
   such as Josephus, the Talmud,  Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and
  </p>
  <p>
   others?"

   Yamauchi smiled. "We would still have a considerable amount of
  </p>
  <p>
   important historical evidence; in fact, it would provide a kind
  </p>
  <p>
   of outline  for the life of Jesus," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then he went on, raising a finger to emphasize each point. "We
  </p>
  <p>
   would know that first, Jesus was a Jewish teacher; second, many
  </p>
  <p>
   people believed that he performed healings and exorcisms; third,
  </p>
  <p>
   some people believed he was the Messiah; fourth, he was rejected
  </p>
  <p>
   by the Jewish leaders; fifth, he was crucified under Pontius
  </p>
  <p>
   Pilate in the reign of Tiberius; sixth, despite this shameful
  </p>
  <p>
   death, his followers, who believed that he was still alive,
  </p>
  <p>
   spread beyond Palestine so that there were multitudes of them in
  </p>
  <p>
   Rome by A.D. 64; and seventh, all kinds of people from the cities
  </p>
  <p>
   and countryside-men and women, slave and free-worshiped him as
  </p>
  <p>
   God."
  </p>
  <p>
   This was indeed an impressive amount of independent
  </p>
  <p>
   corroboration.  And not only can the contours of Jesus' life be
  </p>
  <p>
   reconstructed apart from the Bible, but there's even more that
  </p>
  <p>
   can be gleaned about him from material so old that it actually
  </p>
  <p>
   predates the gospels themselves.
  </p>
  <h2>
   CORROBORATING EARLY DETAILS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The apostle Paul never met Jesus prior to Jesus' death, but he
  </p>
  <p>
   said he did encounter the resurrected Christ and later consulted
  </p>
  <p>
   with some of the eyewitnesses to make sure he was preaching the
  </p>
  <p>
   same message they were. Because he began writing his New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament letters years before the gospels were written down,
  </p>
  <p>
   they contain extremely early reports concerning Jesus-so early
  </p>
  <p>
   that nobody can make a credible claim that they had been
  </p>
  <p>
   seriously distorted by legendary development. "Luke Timothy
  </p>
  <p>
   Johnson, the scholar from Emory University, contends  that Paul's
  </p>
  <p>
   letters represent 'valuable external verification' of the
  </p>
  <p>
   'antiquity and ubiquity' of the traditions about Jesus," I said
  </p>
  <p>
   to Yamauchi. "Do you agree with him?"
  </p>
  <p>
   We had been talking for quite a while. Yamauchi stood briefly to
  </p>
  <p>
   stretch his legs before settling back down. "There's no question
  </p>
  <p>
   that Paul's writings are the earliest in the New Testament," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "and that they do make some very significant references to
  </p>
  <p>
   the life of Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Can you spell them out?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, he refers to the fact that Jesus was a descendant of
  </p>
  <p>
   David, that he was the Messiah, that he was betrayed, that he was
  </p>
  <p>
   tried, crucified  for our sins, and buried, and that he rose
  </p>
  <p>
   again on the third day and was seen by many people-including
  </p>
  <p>
   James, the brother of Jesus who hadn't believed in him prior to
  </p>
  <p>
   his crucifixion.
