  <h2>
   4: THE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Is there Credible Evidence for Jesus outside His Biographies?
  </p>
  <p>
   Harry Aleman turned and stabbed his finger at me. "You,    he
  </p>
  <p>
   sputtered,  spitting out the word with disgust. "Why do you keep
  </p>
  <p>
   writing those things about me?" Then he spun around and
  </p>
  <p>
   disappeared down a back stairwell to escape the reporters who
  </p>
  <p>
   were pursuing him through the courthouse.
  </p>
  <p>
   Actually, it was hard to be a crime reporter in Chicago during
  </p>
  <p>
   the 1970s and not write about Harry Aleman. He was, after all,
  </p>
  <p>
   the quintessential  crime syndicate hit man. And Chicagoans, in a
  </p>
  <p>
   perverse
  </p>
  <p>
   way, love to read about the mob.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prosecutors desperately wanted to put Aleman in prison for one of
  </p>
  <p>
   the cold-blooded executions they suspected he had committed on
  </p>
  <p>
   behalf of his syndicate bosses. The problem, of course, was the
  </p>
  <p>
   difficulty  of finding anyone willing to testify against a
  </p>
  <p>
   mobster of Aleman's  frightening reputation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then came their big break. One of Aleman's former cronies,
  </p>
  <p>
   Louis Almeida, was arrested on his way to murder a labor official
  </p>
  <p>
   in Pennsylvania. Convicted of weapons charges and sentenced to a
  </p>
  <p>
   decade in prison, Almeida agreed to testify against Aleman in the
  </p>
  <p>
   unsolved slaying of a Teamsters Union shop steward in Chicago-if
  </p>
  <p>
   prosecutors would agree to show leniency toward Almeida.
  </p>
  <p>
   This meant Almeida had a motive to cooperate, which would
  </p>
  <p>
   undoubtedly tarnish his credibility to some degree. Prosecutors
  </p>
  <p>
   realized  they would need to bolster his testimony to ensure a
  </p>
  <p>
   conviction, so they went searching for someone to corroborate
  </p>
  <p>
   Almeida's account. Webster's dictionary defines corroborate this
  </p>
  <p>
   way: "To make more certain; confirm: He corroborated my account
  </p>
  <p>
   of the accident."'
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Corroborative evidence supports other testimony; it affirms or
  </p>
  <p>
   backs up the essential elements of an eyewitness account. It can
  </p>
  <p>
   be a public  record, a photograph, or additional testimony from a
  </p>
  <p>
   second or third person. It can verify a person's entire testimony
  </p>
  <p>
   or just key parts of it.
  </p>
  <p>
   In effect, corroborative evidence acts like the support wires
  </p>
  <p>
   that keep a tall antenna straight and unwavering. The more
  </p>
  <p>
   corroborative evidence, the stronger and more secure the case.
  </p>
  <p>
   But where would prosecutors find corroboration of Almeida's
  </p>
  <p>
   story? It came from a surprising source: a quiet, law-abiding
  </p>
  <p>
   citizen named Bobby Lowe told investigators he had been walking
  </p>
  <p>
   his dog when he saw Aleman murder the union steward. Despite
  </p>
  <p>
   Aleman's bone-chilling notoriety, Lowe agreed to back up
  </p>
  <p>
   Almeida's story by testifying against the mobster.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE POWER OF CORROBORATION
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   At Aleman's trial Lowe and Almeida mesmerized jurors with their
  </p>
  <p>
   stories. Almeida's account of driving the getaway car dove tailed
  </p>
  <p>
   with Lowe's straightforward description of seeing Aleman murder
  </p>
  <p>
   his victim  on a public sidewalk the evening of September 27,
  </p>
  <p>
   1972.
  </p>
  <p>
   Prosecutors thought they had woven an airtight case against the
  </p>
  <p>
   feared hit man, yet throughout the trial they sensed something
  </p>
  <p>
   was amiss. Their skepticism first surfaced when Aleman decided
  </p>
  <p>
   against having a jury trial, opting instead to have a judge hear
  </p>
  <p>
   his case. At the end of the trial the prosecutors' worst
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicions were realized:  despite compelling testimony by Lowe
  </p>
  <p>
   and Almeida, the judge ended up declaring Aleman innocent and
  </p>
  <p>
   letting him go free. What had happened? Remember, this took place
  </p>
  <p>
   in Cook County, Illinois, where corruption so often lurks. Years
  </p>
  <p>
   later it was revealed that the judge had been slipped ten
  </p>
  <p>
   thousand dollars in return for the acquittal. When an FBI
  </p>
  <p>
   informant disclosed the bribe, the then retired  judge committed
  </p>
  <p>
   suicide-and prosecutors refiled the murder charge against Aleman.
  </p>
  <p>
   By the time the second trial was held, the law had been changed
  </p>
  <p>
   so that prosecutors could demand that -a jury hear the case.
  </p>
  <p>
   That's what they did-and finally, a full twenty-five years after
  </p>
  <p>
   the murder, Aleman was found guilty and sentenced to one hundred
  </p>
  <p>
   to three hundred  years in prison.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   In spite of the delays, the Aleman saga shows how significant
  </p>
  <p>
   corroborative  evidence can be. And the same is true in dealing
  </p>
  <p>
   with historical  issues. We've already heard, through Dr. Craig
  </p>
  <p>
   Blomberg's
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony, that in the gospels there is excellent eyewitness
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence for the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus. But is there any other evidence to corroborate that? Are
  </p>
  <p>
   there writings outside the gospels that affirm or support any of
  </p>
  <p>
   the essentials about Jesus or early Christianity?
  </p>
  <p>
   In other words, is there any additional documentation that can
  </p>
  <p>
   help seal the case for Christ, as Bobby Lowe's testimony sealed
  </p>
  <p>
   the case against Harry Aleman? The answer, according to our next
  </p>
  <p>
   witness,  is yes-and the amount and quality of that evidence may
  </p>
  <p>
   very well surprise you.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE THIRD INTERVIEW- EDWIN M. YAMAUCHI, PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   As I entered the imposing brick building that houses the office
  </p>
  <p>
   of Edwin Yamauchi at Miami University in picturesque Oxford,
  </p>
  <p>
   Ohio, I walked underneath a stone arch bearing this inscription:
  </p>
  <p>
   "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth will make you free." As
  </p>
  <p>
   one of the country's  leading experts in ancient history,
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi has been on a quest for historical truth for much of his
  </p>
  <p>
   life.
  </p>
  <p>
   Born in Hawaii in 1937, the son of immigrants from Okinawa,
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi started from humble beginnings. His father died just
  </p>
  <p>
   before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, leaving his mother to
  </p>
  <p>
   earn a meager living as a maid for wealthy families. While
  </p>
  <p>
   lacking formal education herself, she encouraged her son to read
  </p>
  <p>
   and study, giving him beautifully illustrated books that
  </p>
  <p>
   instilled in him a lifelong love of learning.
  </p>
  <p>
   Certainly his academic accomplishments have been impressive.
  </p>
  <p>
   After earning a bachelor's degree in Hebrew and Hellenistics,
  </p>
  <p>
   Yamauchi received master's and doctoral degrees in Mediterranean
  </p>
  <p>
   studies from Brandeis University.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has been awarded eight fellowships, from the Rutgers
  </p>
  <p>
   Research Council, National Endowment for the Humanities, the
  </p>
  <p>
   American Philosophical Society, and others. He has studied
  </p>
  <p>
   twenty-two  languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Egyptian,
  </p>
  <p>
   Russian, Syriac,  Ugaritic, and even Commanche.
  </p>
  <p>
   He has delivered seventy-one papers before learned societies;
  </p>
  <p>
   lectured  at more than one hundred seminaries, universities, and
  </p>
  <p>
   colleges, including Yale, Princeton, and Cornell; served as
  </p>
  <p>
   chairman and then president of the Institute for Biblical
  </p>
  <p>
   Research and president of the Conference on Faith and History;
  </p>
  <p>
   and published eighty articles in thirty-seven scholarly journals.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1968 he participated in the first excavations of the Herodian
  </p>
  <p>
   temple in Jerusalem, revealing evidence of the temple's
  </p>
  <p>
   destruction in A.D. 70. Archaeology has also been the theme of
  </p>
  <p>
   several of his books, including The Stones and the Scriptures;
  </p>
  <p>
   The Scriptures and Archaeology; and The World of the First
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians.
  </p>
  <p>
   Though born into a Buddhist background, Yamauchi has been
  </p>
  <p>
   following Jesus ever since 1952, the year I was born. I was
  </p>
  <p>
   especially curious to see whether his long-term commitment to
  </p>
  <p>
   Christ would color his assessment of the historical evidence. In
  </p>
  <p>
   other words, would he scrupulously stick to the facts or be
  </p>
  <p>
   tempted to draw conclusions that went beyond where the evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   warranted?
  </p>
  <p>
   I found Yamauchi to have a gentle and unassuming demeanor.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although generally soft-spoken, he's intensely focused. He
  </p>
  <p>
   provides thorough and detailed answers to questions, often
  </p>
  <p>
   pausing to supplement  his verbal response by offering
  </p>
  <p>
   photocopies of scholarly articles he has written on the topic. A
  </p>
  <p>
   good scholar knows you can never have too much data.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Inside his book-cluttered office, in the heart of a heavily
  </p>
  <p>
   wooded campus ablaze in autumn colors, we sat down to talk about
  </p>
  <p>
   the topic that still brings a glint to his eyes, even after so
  </p>
  <p>
   many years of research and teaching.
  </p>
  <h2>
   AFFIRMING THE GOSPELS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Because of my interview with Blomberg, I didn't want to suggest
  </p>
  <p>
   that we needed to go beyond the gospels in order to find reliable
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence concerning Jesus. So I started by asking Yamauchi this
  </p>
  <p>
   question: "As a historian, could you give me your assessment of
  </p>
  <p>
   the historical reliability  of the gospels themselves?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "On  the whole, the gospels are excellent sources," he replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   "As a matter of fact, they're the most trustworthy, complete, and
  </p>
  <p>
   reliable sources for Jesus. The incidental sources really don't
  </p>
  <p>
   add much detailed information; however, they are valuable as
  </p>
  <p>
   corroborative evidence." "OK, that's what I want to discuss-the
  </p>
  <p>
   corroborative evidence," I said. "Let's be honest: some people
  </p>
  <p>
   scoff at how much there really is. For example, in 1979 Charles
  </p>
  <p>
   Templeton wrote a novel called Act of God, in which a fictional
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeologist made a statement that reflects the beliefs of a lot
  </p>
  <p>
   of people."
  </p>
  <p>
   I pulled out the book and read the relevant paragraph.
  </p>
  <p>
   The [Christian] church bases its claims mostly on the teachings
  </p>
  <p>
   of an obscure young Jew with messianic pretentions who,
  </p>
  <p>
   let's face it, didn't make much of an impression in his lifetime.
  </p>
  <p>
   There isn't a single word about him in secular history. Not a

   word. No mention of him by the Romans. Not so much as a reference
  </p>
  <p>
   by Josephus.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Now," I said a little pointedly, "that doesn't sound as if
  </p>
  <p>
   there's much corroboration of the life of Jesus outside the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible." Yamauchi smiled and shook his head. "Templeton's
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeologist is simply mistaken," he replied in a dismissive
  </p>
  <p>
   tone, "because we do have very, very important references to
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus in Josephus and Tacitus. "The gospels themselves say that
  </p>
  <p>
   many who heard him-even
  </p>
  <p>
   members of his own family-did not believe in Jesus during his
  </p>
  <p>
   lifetime,  yet he made such an impression that today Jesus is
  </p>
  <p>
   remembered everywhere, whereas Herod the Great, Pontius Pilate,
  </p>
  <p>
   and other ancient rulers are not as widely known. So he certainly
  </p>
  <p>
   did make an impression on those who believed in him."
  </p>
  <p>
   He paused, then added, "He did not, of course, among those who
  </p>
  <p>
   did not believe in him."

  <h2>
   TESTIMONY BY A TRAITOR
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Templeton and Yamauchi had both mentioned Josephus, a first-
  </p>
  <p>
   century  historian who's well known among scholars but whose name
  </p>
  <p>
   is unfamiliar to most people today. "Give me some background
  </p>
  <p>
   about him," I said, "and tell me how his testimony provides
  </p>
  <p>
   corroboration concerning Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, of course," Yamauchi answered as he crossed his legs and
  </p>
  <p>
   settled deeper into his chair. "Josephus was a very important
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish historian of the first century. He was born in A.D. 37,
  </p>
  <p>
   and he wrote most of his four works toward the end of the first
  </p>
  <p>
   century. In his autobiography he defended his behavior in the
  </p>
  <p>
   JewishRoman  War, which took place from A.D. 66 to 74. You see,
  </p>
  <p>
   he had surrendered  to the Roman general Vespasian during the
  </p>
  <p>
   siege of
  </p>
  <p>
   Iotapata, even though many of his colleague's committed suicide
  </p>
  <p>
   rather than give up."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The professor chuckled and said, "Josephus decided it wasn't
  </p>
  <p>
   God's will for him to commit suicide. He then became a defender
  </p>
  <p>
   of the Romans."
  </p>
  <p>
   Josephus sounded like a colorful character; I wanted more details
  </p>
  <p>
   about him so I could better understand his motivations and
  </p>
  <p>
   prejudices.  "Paint me a portrait of him," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "He was a priest, a Pharisee, and he was somewhat egotistical.
  </p>
  <p>
   His most ambitious work was called The Antiquities, which was a
  </p>
  <p>
   history  of the Jewish people from Creation until his time. He
