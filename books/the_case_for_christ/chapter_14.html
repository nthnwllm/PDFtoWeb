  <h2>
   4: THE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Is there Credible Evidence for Jesus outside His Biographies? Harry Aleman turned and stabbed his finger at me. "You,    he sputtered,  spitting out the word with disgust. "Why do you keep writing those things about me?" Then he spun around and disappeared down a back stairwell to escape the reporters who were pursuing him through the courthouse. Actually, it was hard to be a crime reporter in Chicago during the 1970s and not write about Harry Aleman. He was, after all, the quintessential  crime syndicate hit man. And Chicagoans, in a perverse way, love to read about the mob. Prosecutors desperately wanted to put Aleman in prison for one of the cold-blooded executions they suspected he had committed on behalf of his syndicate bosses. The problem, of course, was the difficulty  of finding anyone willing to testify against a mobster of Aleman's  frightening reputation. Then came their big break. One of Aleman's former cronies, Louis Almeida, was arrested on his way to murder a labor official in Pennsylvania. Convicted of weapons charges and sentenced to a decade in prison, Almeida agreed to testify against Aleman in the unsolved slaying of a Teamsters Union shop steward in Chicago-if prosecutors would agree to show leniency toward Almeida. This meant Almeida had a motive to cooperate, which would undoubtedly tarnish his credibility to some degree. Prosecutors realized  they would need to bolster his testimony to ensure a conviction, so they went searching for someone to corroborate Almeida's account. Webster's dictionary defines corroborate this way: "To make more certain; confirm: He corroborated my account of the accident."'
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Corroborative evidence supports other testimony; it affirms or backs up the essential elements of an eyewitness account. It can be a public  record, a photograph, or additional testimony from a second or third person. It can verify a person's entire testimony or just key parts of it. In effect, corroborative evidence acts like the support wires that keep a tall antenna straight and unwavering. The more corroborative evidence, the stronger and more secure the case. But where would prosecutors find corroboration of Almeida's story? It came from a surprising source: a quiet, law-abiding citizen named Bobby Lowe told investigators he had been walking his dog when he saw Aleman murder the union steward. Despite Aleman's bone-chilling notoriety, Lowe agreed to back up Almeida's story by testifying against the mobster.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE POWER OF CORROBORATION
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   At Aleman's trial Lowe and Almeida mesmerized jurors with their stories. Almeida's account of driving the getaway car dove tailed with Lowe's straightforward description of seeing Aleman murder his victim  on a public sidewalk the evening of September 27, 1972. Prosecutors thought they had woven an airtight case against the feared hit man, yet throughout the trial they sensed something was amiss. Their skepticism first surfaced when Aleman decided against having a jury trial, opting instead to have a judge hear his case. At the end of the trial the prosecutors' worst suspicions were realized:  despite compelling testimony by Lowe and Almeida, the judge ended up declaring Aleman innocent and letting him go free. What had happened? Remember, this took place in Cook County, Illinois, where corruption so often lurks. Years later it was revealed that the judge had been slipped ten thousand dollars in return for the acquittal. When an FBI informant disclosed the bribe, the then retired  judge committed suicide-and prosecutors refiled the murder charge against Aleman. By the time the second trial was held, the law had been changed so that prosecutors could demand that -a jury hear the case. That's what they did-and finally, a full twenty-five years after the murder, Aleman was found guilty and sentenced to one hundred to three hundred  years in prison.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   In spite of the delays, the Aleman saga shows how significant corroborative  evidence can be. And the same is true in dealing with historical  issues. We've already heard, through Dr. Craig Blomberg's testimony, that in the gospels there is excellent eyewitness evidence for the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus. But is there any other evidence to corroborate that? Are there writings outside the gospels that affirm or support any of the essentials about Jesus or early Christianity? In other words, is there any additional documentation that can help seal the case for Christ, as Bobby Lowe's testimony sealed the case against Harry Aleman? The answer, according to our next witness,  is yes-and the amount and quality of that evidence may very well surprise you.

  <h2>
   THE THIRD INTERVIEW- EDWIN M. YAMAUCHI, PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   As I entered the imposing brick building that houses the office of Edwin Yamauchi at Miami University in picturesque Oxford, Ohio, I walked underneath a stone arch bearing this inscription: "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth will make you free." As one of the country's  leading experts in ancient history, Yamauchi has been on a quest for historical truth for much of his life. Born in Hawaii in 1937, the son of immigrants from Okinawa, Yamauchi started from humble beginnings. His father died just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, leaving his mother to earn a meager living as a maid for wealthy families. While lacking formal education herself, she encouraged her son to read and study, giving him beautifully illustrated books that instilled in him a lifelong love of learning. Certainly his academic accomplishments have been impressive. After earning a bachelor's degree in Hebrew and Hellenistics, Yamauchi received master's and doctoral degrees in Mediterranean studies from Brandeis University. He has been awarded eight fellowships, from the Rutgers Research Council, National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Philosophical Society, and others. He has studied twenty-two  languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Egyptian, Russian, Syriac,  Ugaritic, and even Commanche. He has delivered seventy-one papers before learned societies; lectured  at more than one hundred seminaries, universities, and colleges, including Yale, Princeton, and Cornell; served as chairman and then president of the Institute for Biblical Research and president of the Conference on Faith and History; and published eighty articles in thirty-seven scholarly journals. In 1968 he participated in the first excavations of the Herodian temple in Jerusalem, revealing evidence of the temple's destruction in A.D. 70. Archaeology has also been the theme of several of his books, including The Stones and the Scriptures; The Scriptures and Archaeology; and The World of the First Christians. Though born into a Buddhist background, Yamauchi has been following Jesus ever since 1952, the year I was born. I was especially curious to see whether his long-term commitment to Christ would color his assessment of the historical evidence. In other words, would he scrupulously stick to the facts or be tempted to draw conclusions that went beyond where the evidence warranted? I found Yamauchi to have a gentle and unassuming demeanor. Although generally soft-spoken, he's intensely focused. He provides thorough and detailed answers to questions, often pausing to supplement  his verbal response by offering photocopies of scholarly articles he has written on the topic. A good scholar knows you can never have too much data.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Inside his book-cluttered office, in the heart of a heavily wooded campus ablaze in autumn colors, we sat down to talk about the topic that still brings a glint to his eyes, even after so many years of research and teaching.
  </p>
  <h2>
   AFFIRMING THE GOSPELS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Because of my interview with Blomberg, I didn't want to suggest that we needed to go beyond the gospels in order to find reliable evidence concerning Jesus. So I started by asking Yamauchi this question: "As a historian, could you give me your assessment of the historical reliability  of the gospels themselves?" "On  the whole, the gospels are excellent sources," he replied. "As a matter of fact, they're the most trustworthy, complete, and reliable sources for Jesus. The incidental sources really don't add much detailed information; however, they are valuable as corroborative evidence." "OK, that's what I want to discuss-the corroborative evidence," I said. "Let's be honest: some people scoff at how much there really is. For example, in 1979 Charles Templeton wrote a novel called Act of God, in which a fictional archaeologist made a statement that reflects the beliefs of a lot of people." I pulled out the book and read the relevant paragraph. The [Christian] church bases its claims mostly on the teachings of an obscure young Jew with messianic pretentions who, let's face it, didn't make much of an impression in his lifetime. There isn't a single word about him in secular history. Not a word. No mention of him by the Romans. Not so much as a reference by Josephus. "Now," I said a little pointedly, "that doesn't sound as if there's much corroboration of the life of Jesus outside the Bible." Yamauchi smiled and shook his head. "Templeton's archaeologist is simply mistaken," he replied in a dismissive tone, "because we do have very, very important references to Jesus in Josephus and Tacitus. "The gospels themselves say that many who heard him-even members of his own family-did not believe in Jesus during his lifetime,  yet he made such an impression that today Jesus is remembered everywhere, whereas Herod the Great, Pontius Pilate, and other ancient rulers are not as widely known. So he certainly did make an impression on those who believed in him." He paused, then added, "He did not, of course, among those who did not believe in him."
  </p>
  <h2>
   TESTIMONY BY A TRAITOR
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Templeton and Yamauchi had both mentioned Josephus, a first- century  historian who's well known among scholars but whose name is unfamiliar to most people today. "Give me some background about him," I said, "and tell me how his testimony provides corroboration concerning Jesus." "Yes, of course," Yamauchi answered as he crossed his legs and settled deeper into his chair. "Josephus was a very important Jewish historian of the first century. He was born in A.D. 37, and he wrote most of his four works toward the end of the first century. In his autobiography he defended his behavior in the JewishRoman  War, which took place from A.D. 66 to 74. You see, he had surrendered  to the Roman general Vespasian during the siege of Iotapata, even though many of his colleague's committed suicide rather than give up."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The professor chuckled and said, "Josephus decided it wasn't God's will for him to commit suicide. He then became a defender of the Romans." Josephus sounded like a colorful character; I wanted more details about him so I could better understand his motivations and prejudices.  "Paint me a portrait of him," I said. "He was a priest, a Pharisee, and he was somewhat egotistical. His most ambitious work was called The Antiquities, which was a history  of the Jewish people from Creation until his time. He
