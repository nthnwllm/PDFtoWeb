  <p>
   it fits well with the Gnostic mind-set.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the Jesus Seminar has arbitrarily latched onto certain
  </p>
  <p>
   passages of the Gospel of Thomas and has argued that these
  </p>
  <p>
   passages represent an early strand of tradition about Jesus, even
  </p>
  <p>
   earlier than the canonical gospels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because none of these passages include Jesus making exalted
  </p>
  <p>
   claims for himself or doing supernatural feats, they argue that
  </p>
  <p>
   the earliest  view of Jesus was that he was only a great teacher.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the whole line of reasoning is circular. The only reason for
  </p>
  <p>
   thinking these passages  in Thomas are early in the first place
  </p>
  <p>
   is because they contain a view of Jesus that these scholars
  </p>
  <p>
   already believed was the original Jesus. In truth there is no
  </p>
  <p>
   good reason for preferring the second-century Gospel of Thomas
  </p>
  <p>
   over the first-century gospels of the New Testament."
  </p>
  <h2>
   HISTORY VERSUS FAITH
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The Jesus of history and the Jesus of faith: the Jesus Seminar
  </p>
  <p>
   believes there's a big gulf between the two. In its view the
  </p>
  <p>
   historical Jesus was a bright, witty, countercultural man who
  </p>
  <p>
   never claimed to be the Son of God, while the Jesus of faith is a
  </p>
  <p>
   cluster of feel-good ideas that help people live right but are
  </p>
  <p>
   ultimately based on wishful thinking. "There's not just a gulf
  </p>
  <p>
   between the Jesus of history and the Jesus of faith," Boyd said
  </p>
  <p>
   as I brought up this subject. "If you discredit everything that
  </p>
  <p>
   says Jesus is divine and reconciles people with God, there's an
  </p>
  <p>
   outright contradiction between the two.
  </p>
  <p>
   Generally speaking, they define the Jesus of faith this way:
  </p>
  <p>
   there are religious symbols that are quite meaningful to people-
  </p>
  <p>
   the symbol  of Jesus being divine, of the cross, of self-
  </p>
  <p>
   sacrificial love, of the Resurrection. Even though people don't
  </p>
  <p>
   really believe that those things actually happened, they
  </p>
  <p>
   nevertheless can inspire people to live a good life, to overcome
  </p>
  <p>
   existential angst, to realize new potentialities, to resurrect
  </p>
  <p>
   hope in the midst of despair-blah, blah, blah." He shrugged his
  </p>
  <p>
   shoulders. "Sorry," he said, "I've heard this stuff so much,
  </p>
  <p>
   itcomes out my ears!
  </p>
  <p>
   So these liberals say historical research can't possibly discover
  </p>
  <p>
   the Jesus of faith, because the Jesus of faith is not rooted in
  </p>
  <p>
   history. He's merely a symbol," Boyd continued. "But listen:
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus is not a symbol of anything unless he's rooted in history.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Nicene Creed doesn't say, 'We wish these things were true.'
  </p>
  <p>
   It says, 'Jesus Christ was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and
  </p>
  <p>
   the third day he rose again from the dead,' and it goes on from
  </p>
  <p>
   there.
  </p>
  <p>
   The theological truth is based on historical truth. That's the
  </p>
  <p>
   way the New Testament talks. Look at the sermon of Peter in the
  </p>
  <p>
   second chapter of Acts. He stands up and says, 'You guys are a
  </p>
  <p>
   witness of these things; they weren't done in secret. David's
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb is still with us, but God has raised Jesus from the dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore we proclaim him to be the Son of God.'
  </p>
  <p>
   Take away miracles and you take away the Resurrection, and
  </p>
  <p>
   then you've got nothing to proclaim. Paul said that if Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   wasn't raised from the dead, our faith is futile, it's useless,
  </p>
  <p>
   it's empty." Boyd stopped for a moment. His voice dropped a
  </p>
  <p>
   notch, from
  </p>
  <p>
   preaching mode to an intense expression of personal conviction.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I don't want to base my life on a symbol," he said resolutely.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I want reality, and the Christian faith has always been rooted
  </p>
  <p>
   in reality.  What's not rooted in reality is the faith of liberal
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars. They're the ones who are following a pipe dream, but
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity is not a pipe dream."
  </p>
  <h2>
   COMBINING HISTORY AND FAITH
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   We had spent a lot of time talking about the Jesus of the Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   Seminar-a  symbolic Jesus, but one who's impotent to offer the
  </p>
  <p>
   world
  </p>
  <p>
   anything except the illusion of hope. But before we left, I
  </p>
  <p>
   wanted to hear about the Jesus of Gregory Boyd. I needed to know
  </p>
  <p>
   whether the Jesus he researches and writes scholarly books about
  </p>
  <p>
   as a theology professor is the same Jesus he preaches about in
  </p>
  <p>
   his church on Sunday  mornings.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me get this straight," I said. "Your Jesus-the Jesus you
  </p>
  <p>
   relate to-is both a Jesus of history and a Jesus of faith." Boyd
  </p>
  <p>
   clenched his fist for emphasis, as if I'd just scored a
  </p>
  <p>
   touchdown.  "Yes, that's it exactly, Lee!" he exclaimed. Moving
  </p>
  <p>
   to the very edge of his chair, he spelled out precisely what his
  </p>
  <p>
   scholarship-and his heart-have brought him to believe.
  </p>
  <p>
   "It's like this: if you love a person, your love goes beyond the
  </p>
  <p>
   facts of that person, but it's rooted in the facts about that
  </p>
  <p>
   person. For example,  you love your wife because she's gorgeous,
  </p>
  <p>
   she's nice, she's sweet, she's kind. All these things are facts
  </p>
  <p>
   about your wife, and therefore u love her.
  </p>
  <p>
   But your love goes beyond that. You can know all these things
  </p>
  <p>
   about your wife and not be in love with her and put your trust in
  </p>
  <p>
   her, but you do. So the decision goes beyond the evidence, yet it
  </p>
  <p>
   is there also on the basis of the evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
   So it is with falling in love with Jesus. To have a relationship
  </p>
  <p>
   with Jesus Christ goes beyond just knowing the historical facts
  </p>
  <p>
   about him, yet it's rooted in the historical facts about him. I
  </p>
  <p>
   believe in Jesus on the basis of the historical evidence, but my
  </p>
  <p>
   relationship with Jesus goes way beyond the evidence. I have to
  </p>
  <p>
   put my trust in him and walk with him on a daily basis."
  </p>
  <p>
   I interrupted to say, "Yes, but will you acknowledge that
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity  makes some claims about Jesus that are just plain
  </p>
  <p>
   hard to
  </p>
  <p>
   believe?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, of course I do," he replied. "That's why I'm glad we have
  </p>
  <p>
   such incredibly strong evidence to show us they're true.
  </p>
  <p>
   For me," he added, "it comes down to this: there's no
  </p>
  <p>
   competition.  The evidence for Jesus being who the disciples said
  </p>
  <p>
   he was for  having done the miracles that he did, for rising from
  </p>
  <p>
   the dead, for making the claims that he did-is just light-years
  </p>
  <p>
   beyond my reasons  for thinking that the left-wing scholarship of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Jesus Seminar is correct.
  </p>
  <p>
   What do these scholars have? Well, there's a brief allusion to a
  </p>
  <p>
   lost 'secret' gospel in a late-second-century letter that has
  </p>
  <p>
   unfortunately  only been seen by one person and has now itself
  </p>
  <p>
   been lost. There's a third-century account of the Crucifixion and
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection that stars a talking cross and that less than a
  </p>
  <p>
   handful of scholars think predates the gospels. There's a second-
  </p>
  <p>
   century Gnostic document, parts of which some scholars now want
  </p>
  <p>
   to date early to back up their own preconceptions. And there is a
  </p>
  <p>
   hypothetical document built on shaky assumptions that is being
  </p>
  <p>
   sliced thinner and thinner by using circular reasoning."
  </p>
  <p>
   Boyd flopped back in his chair. "No, I'm sorry," he said, shaking
  </p>
  <p>
   his head. "I don't buy it. It's far more reasonable to put my
  </p>
  <p>
   trust in the gospels-which pass the tests of historical scrutiny
  </p>
  <p>
   with flying colors-than  to put my hope in what the Jesus Seminar
  </p>
  <p>
   is saying."
  </p>
  <h2>
   A CHORUS OF CRITICISM
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Back at my motel, I mentally played back my interview with Boyd.
  </p>
  <p>
   I felt the same way he did: If the Jesus of faith is not also the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus of history, he's powerless and he's meaningless. Unless
  </p>
  <p>
   he's rooted in reality, unless he established his divinity by
  </p>
  <p>
   rising from the dead, he's just a feel-good symbol who's as
  </p>
  <p>
   irrelevant as Santa Claus. But there's good evidence that he's
  </p>
  <p>
   more than that. I had already heard well-supported eyewitness,
  </p>
  <p>
   documentary, corroborating, and scientific evidence supporting
  </p>
  <p>
   the New Testament claim that he is God incarnate, and I was
  </p>
  <p>
   getting ready to hit the road again to dig out even more
  </p>
  <p>
   historical material about his character and resurrection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile Greg Boyd isn't a lone voice crying out against the
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus Seminar. He's part of a growing crescendo of criticism
  </p>
  <p>
   coming not just from prominent conservative evangelicals but also
  </p>
  <p>
   from other well-respected scholars representing a wide variety of
  </p>
  <p>
   theological backgrounds.
  </p>
  <p>
   An example was as close as my motel's nightstand, where I
  </p>
  <p>
   reached over to pick up a book called The Real Jesus, which I had
  </p>
  <p>
   recently purchased. Its author is Dr. Luke Timothy Johnson, the
  </p>
  <p>
   highly regarded professor of New Testament and Christian origins
  </p>
  <p>
   at the Candler School of Theology of Emory University. Johnson is
  </p>
  <p>
   a Roman Catholic who was a Benedictine monk before becoming a
  </p>
  <p>
   biblical  scholar and writing a number of influential books.
  </p>
  <p>
   Johnson systematically skewers the Jesus Seminar, saying it "by
  </p>
  <p>
   no means represents the cream of New Testament scholarship," it
  </p>
  <p>
   follows  a process that is "biased against the authenticity of
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospel traditions," and its results were "already determined
  </p>
  <p>
   ahead of time." He concludes, "This is not responsible, or even
  </p>
  <p>
   critical, scholarship. It is a self-indulgent charade."
  </p>
  <p>
   He goes on to quote other distinguished scholars with similar
  </p>
  <p>
   opinions, including Dr. Howard Clark Kee, who called the Seminar
  </p>
  <p>
   "an academic disgrace," and Richard Hayes of Duke University,
  </p>
  <p>
   whose review of The Five Gospels asserted that "the case argued
  </p>
  <p>
   by this book would not stand up in any court. "
  </p>
  <p>
   I closed the book and turned off the light. Tomorrow I'd resume
  </p>
  <p>
   my hunt for evidence that would stand up.

   Questions for Reflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  Have you read news accounts of the Jesus Seminar's opinions?
  </p>
  <p>
   What was your response to what was reported? Did the articles
  </p>
  <p>
   give you the impression that the Seminar's findings represent the
  </p>
  <p>
   opinions  of the majority of scholars? What dangers do you see in
  </p>
  <p>
   relying  on the news media in reporting on issues of this kind?
  </p>
  <p>
   2.  As you conduct your own investigation of Jesus, should you
  </p>
  <p>
   rule out any possibility of the supernatural at the outset, or
  </p>
  <p>
   should you allow yourself to consider all the evidence of
  </p>
  <p>
   history, even if it points toward the miraculous as having
  </p>
  <p>
   occurred? Why?
  </p>
  <p>
   3.  Boyd said, "I don't want to base my life on a symbol. I want
  </p>
  <p>
   reality  ......"  Why do you agree or disagree? Is it enough that
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus is a symbol of hope, or is it important for you to be
  </p>
  <p>
   confident that his life, teachings, and resurrection are rooted
  </p>
  <p>
   in history? Why?

   Was jesus Really Convinced That He Was the Son of God?
  </p>
  <p>
   John Douglas has an uncanny ability to look into the minds of
  </p>
  <p>
   people he has never met.
  </p>
  <p>
   As the original "psychological profiler" for the Federal Bureau
  </p>
  <p>
   of Investigation, Douglas would gather information at a crime
  </p>
  <p>
   scene and then use his insights to peer inside the personality of
  </p>
  <p>
   the still-at-large  perpetrator.
  </p>
  <p>
   Case in point: Douglas predicted that the "Trailside Killer," a
  </p>
  <p>
   serial murderer who stalked wooded areas near San Francisco from
  </p>
  <p>
   1979 to 1981, would be someone who had a speech impediment as
  </p>
  <p>
   well as tendencies toward animal cruelty, bed-wetting, and arson.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sure enough, the person finally arrested and convicted in the
  </p>
  <p>
   case fit those descriptions perfectly.
