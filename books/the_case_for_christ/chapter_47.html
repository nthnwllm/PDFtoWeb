   about Jewish culture.
  </p>
  <p>
   "At the time of Jesus, the Jews had been persecuted for seven
  </p>
  <p>
   hundred years by the Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, and now by
  </p>
  <p>
   the Greeks and the Romans," Moreland explained. "Many Jews had
  </p>
  <p>
   been scattered and lived as captives in these other nations.
  </p>
  <p>
   "However, we still see Jews today, while we don't see Hittites,
  </p>
  <p>
   Perizzites,  Ammonites, Assyrians, Persians, Babylonians, and
  </p>
  <p>
   other people who had been living in that time. Why? Because these
  </p>
  <p>
   people got captured  by other nations, intermarried, and lost
  </p>
  <p>
   their national identity. "Why didn't that happen to the Jews?
  </p>
  <p>
   Because the things that made the Jews, Jews-the social structures
  </p>
  <p>
   that gave them their national identity-were unbelievably
  </p>
  <p>
   important to them. The Jews would pass these structures down to
  </p>
  <p>
   their children, celebrate them in synagogue meetings every
  </p>
  <p>
   Sabbath, and reinforce them with their rituals,  because they
  </p>
  <p>
   knew if they didn't, there soon would be no Jews left. They would
  </p>
  <p>
   be assimilated into the cultures that captured them. And there's
  </p>
  <p>
   another reason why these social institutions were so important:
  </p>
  <p>
   they believed these institutions were entrusted to them by God.
  </p>
  <p>
   They believed that to abandon these institutions would be to risk
  </p>
  <p>
   their souls being damned to hell after death.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now a rabbi named Jesus appears from a lower-class region. He
  </p>
  <p>
   teaches for three years, gathers a following of lower- and
  </p>
  <p>
   middle-class people, gets in trouble with the authorities, and
  </p>
  <p>
   gets crucified along with thirty thousand other Jewish men who
  </p>
  <p>
   are executed during this time period.
  </p>
  <p>
   But five weeks after he's crucified, over ten thousand Jews are
  </p>
  <p>
   following him and claiming that he is the initiator of a new
  </p>
  <p>
   religion. And get this: they're willing to give up or alter all
  </p>
  <p>
   five of the social institutions that they have been taught since
  </p>
  <p>
   childhood have such importance both sociologically and
  </p>
  <p>
   theologically."
  </p>
  <p>
   "So the implication is that something big was going on," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreland exclaimed, "Something very big was going on!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Revolutionizing Jewish Life
  </p>
  <p>
   I invited Moreland to go through these five social structures and
  </p>
  <p>
   explain how the followers of Jesus had changed or abandoned them.
  </p>
  <p>
   "First," he said, "they had been taught ever since the time of
  </p>
  <p>
   Abraham and Moses that they needed to offer an animal sacrifice
  </p>
  <p>
   on a yearly basis to atone for their sins. God would transfer
  </p>
  <p>
   their sins to that animal, and their sins would be forgiven so
  </p>
  <p>
   they could be in right standing with him. But all of a sudden,
  </p>
  <p>
   after the death of this Nazarene carpenter, these Jewish people
  </p>
  <p>
   no longer offer sacrifices. Second, Jews emphasized obeying the
  </p>
  <p>
   laws that God had
  </p>
  <p>
   entrusted to them through Moses. In their view, this is what
  </p>
  <p>
   separated them from pagan nations. Yet within a short time after
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus' death, Jews were beginning to say that you don't become an
  </p>
  <p>
   upstanding member of their community merely by keeping Moses'
  </p>
  <p>
   laws.
  </p>
  <p>
   Third, Jews scrupulously kept the Sabbath by not doing anything
  </p>
  <p>
   except religious devotion every Saturday. This is how they would
  </p>
  <p>
   earn right standing with God, guarantee the salvation of their
  </p>
  <p>
   family, and be in right standing with the nation. However, after
  </p>
  <p>
   the death of this Nazarene carpenter, this fifteen-hundred-year
  </p>
  <p>
   tradition is abruptly changed. These Christians worship on
  </p>
  <p>
   Sunday-why?
  </p>
  <p>
   Because that's when Jesus rose from the dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   Fourth, they believed in monotheism-only one God. While
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians  teach a form of monotheism, they say that the Father,
  </p>
  <p>
   Son, and Holy Spirit are one God. This is radically different
  </p>
  <p>
   from what the Jews believed. They would have considered it the
  </p>
  <p>
   height of heresy to say someone could be God and man at the same
  </p>
  <p>
   time. Yet Jews begin to worship  Jesus as God within the first
  </p>
  <p>
   decade of the Christian religion. And fifth, these Christians
  </p>
  <p>
   pictured the Messiah as someone who suffered and died for the
  </p>
  <p>
   sins of the world, whereas Jews had been trained to believe that
  </p>
  <p>
   the Messiah was going to be a political leader who would destroy
  </p>
  <p>
   the Roman armies."
  </p>
  <p>
   With that context established, Moreland went in for the
  </p>
  <p>
   rhetorical  kill, drilling me with his intense and unwavering
  </p>
  <p>
   gaze. "Lee," he said, "how can you possibly explain why in a
  </p>
  <p>
   short period of time not just one Jew but an entire community of
  </p>
  <p>
   at least ten thousand Jews were willing to give up these five key
  </p>
  <p>
   practices that had served them sociologically and theologically
  </p>
  <p>
   for so many centuries? My explanation  is simple: they had seen
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus risen from the dead."
  </p>
  <p>
   While Moreland's point was extremely impressive, I saw a problem
  </p>
  <p>
   in people understanding it today. I told him that it's very
  </p>
  <p>
   difficult for twentieth-century Americans to appreciate the
  </p>
  <p>
   radical nature of this transformation.
  </p>
  <p>
   "These days people are fluid in their faith," I said. "They
  </p>
  <p>
   bounce back and forth between Christianity and New Age beliefs.
  </p>
  <p>
   They dabble  in Buddhism, they mix and match and create their own
  </p>
  <p>
   spirituality.  For them, making the kind of changes you mentioned
  </p>
  <p>
   wouldn't seem like a big deal."
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreland nodded. He had apparently heard this objection before.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I'd ask a person like that, 'What's your most cherished belief?
  </p>
  <p>
   That your parents were good people? That murder is immoral? Think
  </p>
  <p>
   about how radical something must be to get you to change or give
  </p>
  <p>
   up that belief you treasure so much. Now we're starting to get
  </p>
  <p>
   close.' "Keep in mind that this is an entire community of people
  </p>
  <p>
   who are abandoning treasured beliefs that have been passed on for
  </p>
  <p>
   centuries and that they believed were from God himself. They were
  </p>
  <p>
   doing it even though they were jeopardizing their own well-being,
  </p>
  <p>
   and they also believed they were risking the damnation of their
  </p>
  <p>
   souls to hell if they were wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
   What's more, they were not doing this because they had come upon
  </p>
  <p>
   better ideas. They were very content with the old traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
   They gave them up because they had seen miracles that they could
  </p>
  <p>
   not explain and that forced them to see the world another way." -
  </p>
  <p>
   We're Western individualists who like technological and
  </p>
  <p>
   sociological  change," I observed. "Traditions don't mean as much
  </p>
  <p>
   to us." "I'll grant that," Moreland replied. "But these people
  </p>
  <p>
   did value tradition. They lived in a period in which the older
  </p>
  <p>
   something was, the better. In fact, for them the farther back
  </p>
  <p>
   they could trace an idea, the more likely it was to be true. So
  </p>
  <p>
   to come up with new ideas was opposite  of the way we are today.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Believe me," he concluded, "these changes to the Jewish social
  </p>
  <p>
   structures were not just minor adjustments that were casually
  </p>
  <p>
   made - they  were absolutely monumental. This was nothing short
  </p>
  <p>
   of a social earthquake! And earthquakes don't happen without a
  </p>
  <p>
   cause."
  </p>
  <h2>
   EXHIBIT 4: COMMUNION AND BAPTISM
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Moreland pointed to the emergence of the sacraments of Communion
  </p>
  <p>
   and baptism in the early church as more circumstantial evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   that the Resurrection is true. But I had some doubts.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Isn't it only natural that religions would create their own
  </p>
  <p>
   rituals and practices?" I asked. "All religions have them. So how
  </p>
  <p>
   does that prove anything about the Resurrection?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Ah, but let's consider Communion for a moment," he replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What's odd is that these early followers of Jesus didn't get
  </p>
  <p>
   together to celebrate his teachings or how wonderful he was. They
  </p>
  <p>
   came together regularly to have a celebration meal for one
  </p>
  <p>
   reason: to remember that Jesus had been publicly slaughtered in a
  </p>
  <p>
   grotesque and humiliating way.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Think about this in modern terms. If a group of people loved
  </p>
  <p>
   John F. Kennedy, they might meet regularly to remember his
  </p>
  <p>
   confrontation  with Russia, his promotion of civil rights, and
  </p>
  <p>
   his charismatic  personality. But they're not going to celebrate
  </p>
  <p>
   the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald murdered him!
  </p>
  <p>
   "However, that's analogous to what these early Christians did.
  </p>
  <p>
   How do you explain that? I explain it this way: they realized
  </p>
  <p>
   that Jesus' slaying was a necessary step to a much greater
  </p>
  <p>
   victory. His murder wasn't the last word-the last word was that
  </p>
  <p>
   he had conquered  death for all of us by rising from the dead.
  </p>
  <p>
   They celebrated his execution because they were convinced that
  </p>
  <p>
   they had seen him alive from the tomb."
  </p>
  <p>
   "What about baptism?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The early church adopted a form of baptism from their Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   upbringing, called proselyte baptism. When Gentiles wanted to
  </p>
  <p>
   take upon themselves the laws of Moses, the Jews would baptize
  </p>
  <p>
   those Gentiles in the authority of the God of Israel. But in the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament,  people were baptized in the name of God the
  </p>
  <p>
   Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit-which meant they had
  </p>
  <p>
   elevated Jesus to the full status of God.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Not only that, but baptism was a celebration of the death of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus, just as Communion was. By going under the water, you're
  </p>
  <p>
   celebrating  his death, and by being brought out of the water,
  </p>
  <p>
   you're celebrating  the fact that Jesus was raised to newness of
  </p>
  <p>
   life."
  </p>
  <p>
   I interrupted by saying, "You're assuming that these sacraments
  </p>
  <p>
   weren't merely adapted from the so-called mystery religions."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And for good reasons," Moreland replied. "First, there's no hard
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence that any mystery religion believed in gods dying and
  </p>
  <p>
   rising, until after the New Testament period. So if there was any

   borrowing, they borrowed from Christianity.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Second, the practice of baptism came from Jewish customs, and
  </p>
  <p>
   the Jews were very much against allowing Gentile or Greek ideas
  </p>
  <p>
   to affect their worship. And third, these two sacraments can be
  </p>
  <p>
   dated back to the very earliest Christian community-too early for
  </p>
  <p>
   the influence of any other religions to creep into their
  </p>
  <p>
   understanding of what Jesus' death meant."

   EXHIBIT 5: THE EMERGENCE OF THE CHURCH

  <p>
   Moreland prefaced this final point by saying, "When a major
  </p>
  <p>
   cultural shift takes place, historians always look for events
  </p>
  <p>
   that can explain it." "Yes, that makes sense," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "OK, then let's think about the start of the Christian church.
  </p>
  <p>
   There's no question it began shortly after the death of Jesus and
  </p>
  <p>
   spread so rapidly that within a period of maybe twenty years it
  </p>
  <p>
   had even reached Caesar's palace in Rome. Not only that, but this
  </p>
  <p>
   movement  triumphed over a number of competing ideologies and
  </p>
  <p>
   eventually  overwhelmed the entire Roman empire.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, if you were a Martian looking down on the first century,
  </p>
  <p>
   would you think Christianity or the Roman Empire would survive?
  </p>
  <p>
   You probably wouldn't put money on a ragtag group of people whose
  </p>
  <p>
   primary message was that a crucified carpenter from an obscure
  </p>
  <p>
   village  had triumphed over the grave. Yet it was so successful
  </p>
  <p>
   that today we name our children Peter and Paul and our dogs
  </p>
  <p>
   Caesar and Nero! "I like the way C. F. D. Moule, the Cambridge
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament scholar, put it: 'If the coming into existence of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Nazarenes, a phenomenon  undeniably attested by the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament, rips a great hole in history, a hole the size and
  </p>
  <p>
   shape of Resurrection, what does the secular historian propose to
  </p>
  <p>
   stop it up with?'"
  </p>
  <p>
   While this wasn't Moreland's strongest point, since other
  </p>
  <p>
   religious  movements have popped up and spread too,
  </p>
  <p>
   circumstantial evidence  doesn't rely solely on the strength of
  </p>
  <p>
   one fact. Rather it's the cumulative weight of several facts that
  </p>
  <p>
   together tip the scales toward a conclusion. And to Moreland, the
  </p>
  <p>
   conclusion is clear.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Look," he said, "if someone wants to consider this
  </p>
  <p>
   circumstantial  evidence and reach the verdict that Jesus did not
  </p>
  <p>
   rise from the dead-fair enough. But they've got to offer an
  </p>
  <p>
   alternative explanation  that is plausible for all five of these
  </p>
  <p>
   facts.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Remember, there's no doubt these facts are true; what's in
  </p>
  <p>
   question  is how to explain them. And I've never seen a better
  </p>
  <p>
   explanation than the Resurrection."
  </p>
  <p>
   I mentally played back the tape of the circumstantial evidence:
  </p>
  <p>
   the willingness of the disciples to die for what they
  </p>
  <p>
   experienced; the revolutionized lives of skeptics like James and
  </p>
  <p>
   Saul; the radical changes in social structures cherished by Jews
  </p>
  <p>
   for centuries; the sudden  appearance of Communion and baptism;
