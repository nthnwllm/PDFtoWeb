  <p>
   question of whether the New Testament accounts of Jesus are
  </p>
  <p>
   accurate.  While serology and toxicology aren't able to shed any
  </p>
  <p>
   light on the issue, another category of scientific proof-the
  </p>
  <p>
   discipline of archaeology-has  great bearing on the reliability
  </p>
  <p>
   of the gospels.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sometimes called the study of durable rubbish, archaeology
  </p>
  <p>
   involves the uncovering of artifacts, architecture, art, coins,
  </p>
  <p>
   monuments,  documents, and other remains of ancient cultures.
  </p>
  <p>
   Experts
  </p>
  <p>
   study these relics to learn what life was like in the days when
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus walked the dusty roads of ancient Palestine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Hundreds of archaeological findings from the first century have
  </p>
  <p>
   been unearthed, and I was curious: did they undermine or
  </p>
  <p>
   undergird the eyewitness stories about Jesus? At the same time,
  </p>
  <p>
   my curiosity was tempered by skepticism. I have heard too many
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians make exorbitant claims that archaeology can prove a
  </p>
  <p>
   lot more than it really can. I wasn't interested in more of the
  </p>
  <p>
   same.
  </p>
  <p>
   So I went on a quest for a recognized authority who has
  </p>
  <p>
   personally dug among the ruins of the Middle East, who has an
  </p>
  <p>
   encyclopedic knowledge of ancient findings, and who possesses
  </p>
  <p>
   enough scientific restraint to acknowledge the limits of
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeology while at the same time explaining how it can
  </p>
  <p>
   illuminate life in the first century.

  <h2>
   THE FOURTH INTERVIEW: JOHN MCRAY, PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   When scholars and students study archaeology, many turn to John
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay's thorough and dispassionate 432-page textbook Archaeology
  </p>
  <p>
   and the New Testament. When the Arts and Entertainment Television
  </p>
  <p>
   Network wanted to ensure the accuracy of its Mysteries of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Bible program, they called McRay as well. And when National
  </p>
  <p>
   Geographic needed a scientist who could explain the intricacies
  </p>
  <p>
   of the biblical world, again the phone rang in McRay's office at
  </p>
  <p>
   well-respected Wheaton College in suburban Chicago.
  </p>
  <p>
   Having studied at Hebrew University, the cole Biblique et
  </p>
  <p>
   Arch6ologique Franaise in Jerusalem, Vanderbilt University
  </p>
  <p>
   Divinity  School, and the University of Chicago (where he earned
  </p>
  <p>
   his doctorate  in 1967), McRay has been a professor of New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament and
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeology at Wheaton for more than fifteen years. His articles
  </p>
  <p>
   have appeared in seventeen encyclopedias and dictionaries, his
  </p>
  <p>
   research has been featured in the Bulletin of the Near East
  </p>
  <p>
   Archaeology Society  and other academic journals, and he has
  </p>
  <p>
   presented twenty-nine scholarly papers at professional societies.
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay is also a former research associate and trustee of the W.
  </p>
  <p>
   F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem; a
  </p>
  <p>
   former  trustee of the American Schools of Oriental Research; a
  </p>
  <p>
   current trustee of the Near East Archaeological Society; and a
  </p>
  <p>
   member of the editorial boards of Archaeology in the Biblical
  </p>
  <p>
   World and the Bulletin for Biblical Research, which is published
  </p>
  <p>
   by the Institute for Biblical Research.
  </p>
  <p>
   As much as McRay enjoys writing and teaching about the ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   world, he relishes opportunities to personally explore
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeological digs. He supervised excavating teams at Caesarea,
  </p>
  <p>
   Sepphoris, and
  </p>
  <p>
   Herodium, all in Israel, over an eight-year period. He has
  </p>
  <p>
   studied RoInan archaeological sites in England and Wales,
  </p>
  <p>
   analyzed digs in Greece, and retraced much of the apostle Paul's
  </p>
  <p>
   journeys.
  </p>
  <p>
   At age sixty-six, McRay's hair is turning silvery and his glasses
  </p>
  <p>
   have become thicker, but he still exudes an air of adventure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Over the desk in his office-and in fact also over his bed at
  </p>
  <p>
   home-is a detailed horizontal photograph of Jerusalem. "I live in
  </p>
  <p>
   the shadow of it, he remarked, a sense of longing in his voice,
  </p>
  <p>
   as he pointed out specific locations of excavations and
  </p>
  <p>
   significant findings. His office features the kind of cozy couch
  </p>
  <p>
   you'd find on the front porch of a country home. I settled into
  </p>
  <p>
   it while McRay, casually dressed in an open-necked shirt and a
  </p>
  <p>
   sports jacket that looked comfortably  worn, leaned back in his
  </p>
  <p>
   desk chair.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seeking to test whether he would overstate the influence of
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeology, I decided to open our interview by asking him what
  </p>
  <p>
   it can't tell us about the reliability of the New Testament.
  </p>
  <p>
   After all, as McRay notes in his textbook, even if archaeology
  </p>
  <p>
   can establish that the cities of Medina and Mecca existed in
  </p>
  <p>
   western Arabia during the sixth and seventh centuries, that
  </p>
  <p>
   doesn't prove that Muhammad lived there or that the Koran is
  </p>
  <p>
   true.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Archaeology has made some important contributions," he began,
  </p>
  <p>
   speaking in a drawl he picked up as a child in southeastern
  </p>
  <p>
   Oklahoma,  "but it certainly can't proved whether the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament is the Word of God. If we dig in Israel and find
  </p>
  <p>
   ancient sites that are consistent  with where the Bible said we'd
  </p>
  <p>
   find them, that shows that its history and geography are
  </p>
  <p>
   accurate. However, it doesn't confirm that what Jesus Christ said
  </p>
  <p>
   is right. Spiritual truths cannot be proved or disproved by
  </p>
  <p>
   archaeological discoveries."
  </p>
  <p>
   As an analogy, he offered the story of Heinrich Schliemann, who
  </p>
  <p>
   searched for Troy in an effort to prove the historical accuracy
  </p>
  <p>
   of Homer's Iliad. "He did find Troy," McRay observed with a
  </p>
  <p>
   gentle smile, "but that didn't prove the Iliad was true. It was
  </p>
  <p>
   merely accurate  in a particular geographical reference."
  </p>
  <p>
   Once we had set some boundaries for what archaeology can't
  </p>
  <p>
   establish, I was anxious to begin exploring what it can tell us
  </p>
  <p>
   about the New Testament. I decided to launch into this topic by
  </p>
  <p>
   making an observation that grew out of my experience as an
  </p>
  <p>
   investigative journalist  with a legal background.
  </p>
  <h2>
   DIGGING FOR THE TRUTH
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   In trying to determine if a witness is being truthful,
  </p>
  <p>
   journalists and lawyers will test all the elements of his or her
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony that can be tested. If this investigation reveals that
  </p>
  <p>
   the person was wrong in those details, this casts considerable
  </p>
  <p>
   doubt on the veracity of his or her entire story. However, if the
  </p>
  <p>
   minutiae check out, this is some indication-not  conclusive proof
  </p>
  <p>
   but some evidence-that maybe the witness
  </p>
  <p>
   is being reliable in his or her overall account.
  </p>
  <p>
   For instance, if a man were telling about a trip he took from St.
  </p>
  <p>
   Louis to Chicago, and he mentioned that he had stopped in
  </p>
  <p>
   Springfield,  Illinois, to see the movie Titanic at the Odeon
  </p>
  <p>
   Theater and that he had eaten a large Clark bar he bought at the
  </p>
  <p>
   concession counter, investigators could determine whether such a
  </p>
  <p>
   theater exists in Springfield  as well as if it was showing this
  </p>
  <p>
   particular film and selling this specific brand and size of candy
  </p>
  <p>
   bar at the time he said he was there. If their findings
  </p>
  <p>
   contradict what the person claimed, this seriously tarnishes his
  </p>
  <p>
   trustworthiness. If the details check out, this doesn't prove
  </p>
  <p>
   that his entire story is true, but it does enhance his reputation
  </p>
  <p>
   for being accurate.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a sense, this is what archaeology accomplishes. The premise is
  </p>
  <p>
   that if an ancient historian's incidental details check out to be
  </p>
  <p>
   accurate  time after time, this increases our confidence in other
  </p>
  <p>
   material that the historian wrote but that cannot be as readily
  </p>
  <p>
   cross-checked. So I asked McRay for his professional opinion.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Does archaeology  affirm or undermine the New Testament when it
  </p>
  <p>
   checks out the details in those accounts?"
  </p>
  <p>
   McRay was quick to answer. "Oh, there's no question that the
  </p>
  <p>
   credibility of the New Testament is enhanced," he said, "just as
  </p>
  <p>
   the credibility of any ancient document is enhanced when you
  </p>
  <p>
   excavate and find that the author was accurate in talking about a
  </p>
  <p>
   particular place or event."
  </p>
  <p>
   As an example, he brought up his own digs in Caesarea on the
  </p>
  <p>
   coast of Israel, where he and others excavated the harbor of
  </p>
  <p>
   Herod the Great.
  </p>
  <p>
   "For a long time people questioned the validity of a statement by
  </p>
  <p>
   Josephus, the first-century historian, that this harbor was as
  </p>
  <p>
   large as the one at Piraeus, which is a major harbor of Athens.
  </p>
  <p>
   People thought Josephus was wrong, because when you see the
  </p>
  <p>
   stones above the surface  of the water in the contemporary
  </p>
  <p>
   harbor, it's not very big. But when we began to do underwater
  </p>
  <p>
   excavation, we found that the harbor extended far out into the
  </p>
  <p>
   water underground, that it had fallen down, and that its total
  </p>
  <p>
   dimensions were indeed comparable to the harbor at Piraeus. So it
  </p>
  <p>
   turns out Josephus was right after all. This was one more bit of
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence that Josephus knew what he was talking  about."
  </p>
  <p>
   So what about the New Testament writers? Did they really know
  </p>
  <p>
   what they were talking about? I wanted to put that issue to the
  </p>
  <p>
   test in my next line of questioning.
  </p>
  <h2>
   LUKE'S ACCURACY AS A HISTORIAN
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The physician and historian Luke authored both the gospel bearing
  </p>
  <p>
   his name and the book of Acts, which together constitute about
  </p>
  <p>
   onequarter  of the entire New Testament. Consequently, a critical
  </p>
  <p>
   issue is whether Luke was a historian who could be trusted to get
  </p>
  <p>
   things right. "When archaeologists check out the details of what
  </p>
  <p>
   he wrote," I said, "do they find that he was careful or sloppy?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "The general consensus of both liberal and conservative scholars
  </p>
  <p>
   is that Luke is very accurate as a historian," McRay replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   "He's erudite, he's eloquent, his Greek approaches classical
  </p>
  <p>
   quality, he writes as an educated man, and archaeological
  </p>
  <p>
   discoveries are showing  over and over again that Luke is

  <p>
   been several instances, similar to the story about the harbor, in

  <p>
   which scholars initially thought Luke was wrong in a particular
  </p>
  <p>
   reference, only to have later discoveries confirm that he was

  <p>

   For instance, in Luke 3:1 he refers to Lysanias being the
