   abandon if I were ever to change my views and become a follower
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
   As far as I was concerned, the case was closed. There was enough
  </p>
  <p>
   proof for me to rest easy with the conclusion that the divinity
  </p>
  <p>
   of Jesus was nothing more than the fanciful invention of
  </p>
  <p>
   superstitious people. Or so I thought.
  </p>
  <h2>
   ANSWERS FOR AN ATHEIST
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   It wasn't a phone call from an informant that prompted me to
  </p>
  <p>
   reexamine  the case for Christ. It was my wife.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leslie stunned me in the autumn of 1979 by announcing that she
  </p>
  <p>
   had become a Christian. I rolled my eyes and braced for the
  </p>
  <p>
   worst, feeling like the victim of a bait-and-switch scam. I had
  </p>
  <p>
   married one Leslie-the fun Leslie, the carefree Leslie, the risk-
  </p>
  <p>
   taking Leslie and  now I feared she was going to turn into some
  </p>
  <p>
   sort of sexually repressed prude who would trade our upwardly
  </p>
  <p>
   mobile lifestyle for all-night prayer vigils and volunteer work
  </p>
  <p>
   in grimy soup kitchens. Instead I was pleasantly surprised-even
  </p>
  <p>
   fascinated-by the
  </p>
  <p>
   fundamental changes in her character, her integrity, and her
  </p>
  <p>
   personal confidence. Eventually I wanted to get to the bottom of
  </p>
  <p>
   what was prompting these subtle but significant shifts in my
  </p>
  <p>
   wife's attitudes, so I launched an all-out investigation into the
  </p>
  <p>
   facts surrounding the case for Christianity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Setting aside my self-interest and prejudices as best I could, I
  </p>
  <p>
   read books, interviewed experts, asked questions, analyzed
  </p>
  <p>
   history, explored archaeology, studied ancient literature, and
  </p>
  <p>
   for the first time in my life picked apart the Bible verse by
  </p>
  <p>
   verse.
  </p>
  <p>
   I plunged into the case with more vigor than with any story I had
  </p>
  <p>
   ever pursued. I applied the training I had received at Yale Law
  </p>
  <p>
   School as well as my experience as legal affairs editor of the
  </p>
  <p>
   Chicago Tribune.  And over time the evidence of the world-of
  </p>
  <p>
   history, of science,  of philosophy, of psychology -began to
  </p>
  <p>
   point toward the
  </p>
  <p>
   unthinkable.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was like the James Dixon case revisited.
  </p>
  <h2>
   JUDGING FOR YOURSELF
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Maybe you too have been basing your spiritual outlook on the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence  you've observed around you or gleaned long ago from
  </p>
  <p>
   books, college professors, family members, or friends. But is
  </p>
  <p>
   your conclusion  really the best possible explanation for the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence? If you were to dig deeper-to confront your
  </p>
  <p>
   preconceptions and systematically seek out proof-what would you
  </p>
  <p>
   find?
  </p>
  <p>
   That's what this book is about. In effect, I'm going to retrace
  </p>
  <p>
   and expand upon the spiritual journey I took for nearly two
  </p>
  <p>
   years. I'll take you along as I interview thirteen leading
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars and authorities who have impeccable academic
  </p>
  <p>
   credentials.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   I have crisscrossed the country-from Minnesota to Georgia,
  </p>
  <p>
   from Virginia to California-to elicit their expert opinions, to
  </p>
  <p>
   challenge  them with the objections I had when I was a skeptic,
  </p>
  <p>
   to force them to defend their positions with solid data and
  </p>
  <p>
   cogent arguments, and to test them with the very questions that
  </p>
  <p>
   you might ask if given the opportunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   In this quest for truth, I've used my experience as a legal
  </p>
  <p>
   affairs journalist to look at numerous categories of proof-
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitness evidence,  documentary evidence, corroborating
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence, rebuttal evidence,  scientific evidence, psychological
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence, circumstantial evidence, and, yes, even fingerprint
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence (that sounds intriguing,  doesn't it?).
  </p>
  <p>
   These are the same classifications that you'd encounter in a
  </p>
  <p>
   courtroom. And maybe taking a legal perspective is the best way
  </p>
  <p>
   to envision this process-with you in the role of a juror.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you were selected for a jury in a real trial, you would be
  </p>
  <p>
   asked to affirm up front that you haven't formed any
  </p>
  <p>
   preconceptions about the case. You would be required to vow that
  </p>
  <p>
   you would be openminded  and fair, drawing your conclusions based
  </p>
  <p>
   on the weight of the facts and not on your whims or prejudices.
  </p>
  <p>
   You would be urged to thoughtfully consider the credibility of
  </p>
  <p>
   the witnesses, carefully sift the testimony, and rigorously
  </p>
  <p>
   subject the evidence to your common sense and logic. I'm asking
  </p>
  <p>
   you to do the same thing while reading this book.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultimately it's the responsibility of jurors to reach a verdict.
  </p>
  <p>
   That doesn't mean they have one-hundred-percent certainty,
  </p>
  <p>
   because we can't have absolute proof about anything in life. In a
  </p>
  <p>
   trial, jurors are asked to weigh the evidence and come to the
  </p>
  <p>
   best possible conclusion.  In other words, harkening back to the
  </p>
  <p>
   James Dixon case, which scenario fits the facts most snugly?
  </p>
  <p>
   That's your task. I hope you take it seriously, because there may
  </p>
  <p>
   be more than just idle curiosity hanging in the balance. If Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   is to be believed-and I realize that may be a big if for you at
  </p>
  <p>
   this point then  nothing is more important than how you respond
  </p>
  <p>
   to him.
  </p>
  <p>
   But who was he really? Who did he claim to be? And is there any
  </p>
  <p>
   credible evidence to back up his assertions? That's what we'll
  </p>
  <p>
   seek to determine as we board a flight for Denver to conduct our
  </p>
  <p>
   first interview.

  <h2>
   PART 1
  </h2>
  <h2>
   Examining the Record
  </h2>
  <h2>
   1: THE EYEWITNESS EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Can the Biographies of Jesus Be Trusted?
  </p>
  <p>
   When I first met shy and soft-spoken Leo Carter, he was a
  </p>
  <p>
   seventeen-year-old  veteran of Chicago's grittiest neighborhood.
  </p>
  <p>
   His
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony had put three killers in prison. And he was still
  </p>
  <p>
   carrying a .38-caliber slug in his skull-a grisly reminder of a
  </p>
  <p>
   horrific saga that began when he witnessed Elijah Baptist gun
  </p>
  <p>
   down a local grocer. Leo and a friend, Leslie Scott, were playing
  </p>
  <p>
   basketball when they saw Elijah, then a sixteen-year-old
  </p>
  <p>
   delinquent with thirty arrests on his rap sheet, slay Sam Blue
  </p>
  <p>
   outside his grocery store.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leo had known the grocer since childhood. "When we didn't have
  </p>
  <p>
   any food, he'd give us some, Leo explained to me in a quiet
  </p>
  <p>
   voice. "So when I went to the hospital and they said he was dead,
  </p>
  <p>
   I knew I'd have to testify about what I saw."
  </p>
  <p>
   Eyewitness testimony is powerful. One of the most dramatic
  </p>
  <p>
   moments in a trial is when a witness describes in detail the
  </p>
  <p>
   crime that he or she saw and then points confidently toward the
  </p>
  <p>
   defendant as being the perpetrator. Elijah Baptist knew that the
  </p>
  <p>
   only way to avoid prison would be to somehow prevent Leo Carter
  </p>
  <p>
   and Leslie Scott from doing just that.
  </p>
  <p>
   So Elijah and two of his pals went hunting. Soon they tracked
  </p>
  <p>
   down Leo and Leslie, who were walking down the street with Leo's
  </p>
  <p>
   brother Henry, and they dragged all three at gunpoint to a
  </p>
  <p>
   darkened loading dock nearby.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I like you," Elijah's cousin said to Leo, "but I've got to do
  </p>
  <p>
   this." With that he pressed a pistol to the bridge of Leo's nose
  </p>
  <p>
   and yanked the trigger.
  </p>
  <p>
   The gun roared; the bullet penetrated at a slight angle, blinding
  </p>
  <p>
   Leo in his right eye and embedding in his head. When he crumbled
  </p>
  <p>
   to the ground, another shot was fired, this bullet lodging two
  </p>
  <p>
   inches from his spine.
  </p>
  <p>
   As Leo watched from his sprawled position, pretending he was
  </p>
  <p>
   dead, he saw his sobbing brother and friend ruthlessly executed
  </p>
  <p>
   at close range. When Elijah and his gang fled, Leo crawled to
  </p>
  <p>
   safety. Somehow, against all odds, Leo Carter lived. The bullet,
  </p>
  <p>
   too precarious  to be removed, remained in his skull. Despite
  </p>
  <p>
   searing
  </p>
  <p>
   headaches that strong medication couldn't dull, he became the
  </p>
  <p>
   sole eyewitness against Elijah Baptist at his trial for killing
  </p>
  <p>
   grocer Sam Blue. The jurors believed Leo, and Elijah was
  </p>
  <p>
   sentenced to eighty years in prison.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again Leo was the only eyewitness to testify against Elijah and
  </p>
  <p>
   his two companions in the slayings of his brother and his friend.
  </p>
  <p>
   And once more his word was good enough to land the trio in prison
  </p>
  <p>
   for the rest of their lives.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leo Carter is one of my heroes. He made sure justice was served,
  </p>
  <p>
   even though he paid a monumental price for it. When I think of
  </p>
  <p>
   eyewitness  testimony, even to this day-more than twenty years
  </p>
  <p>
   later his  face still appears in my mind.
  </p>
  <h2>
   TESTIMONY FROM DISTANT TIME
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Yes, eyewitness testimony can be compelling and convincing. When
  </p>
  <p>
   a witness has had ample opportunity to observe a crime, when
  </p>
  <p>
   there's no bias or ulterior motives, when the witness is truthful
  </p>
  <p>
   and fair, the climactic act of pointing out a defendant in a
  </p>
  <p>
   courtroom can be enough to doom that person to prison or worse.
  </p>
  <p>
   And eyewitness testimony is just as crucial in investigating
  </p>
  <p>
   historicall  matters-even the issue of whether Jesus Christ is
  </p>
  <p>
   the unique Son of God.
  </p>
  <p>
   But what eyewitness accounts do we possess? Do we have the
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony  of anyone who personally interacted with Jesus, who
  </p>
  <p>
   listened to his teachings, who saw his miracles, who witnessed
  </p>
  <p>
   his death, and who perhaps even encountered him after his alleged
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection? Do we have any records from first-century
  </p>
  <p>
   "journalists" who interviewed eyewitnesses, asked tough
  </p>
  <p>
   questions, and faithfully recorded what they scrupulously
  </p>
  <p>
   determined to be true? Equally important, how well would these
  </p>
  <p>
   accounts withstand the scrutiny of skeptics?
  </p>
  <p>
   I knew that just as Leo Carter's testimony clinched the
  </p>
  <p>
   convictions  of three brutal murderers, eyewitness accounts from
  </p>
  <p>
   the mists of distant time could help resolve the most important
  </p>
  <p>
   spiritual issue of all. To get solid answers, I arranged to
  </p>
  <p>
   interview the nationally renowned scholar who literally wrote the
  </p>
  <p>
   book on the topic: Dr. Craig Blomberg, author of The Historical
  </p>
  <p>
   Reliability of the Gospels. I knew Blomberg was smart; in fact,
  </p>
  <p>
   even his appearance fit the stereotype. Tall (six feet two) and
  </p>
  <p>
   lanky, with short, wavy brown hair unceremoniously combed
  </p>
  <p>
   forward, a fuzzy beard, and thick, rimless glasses, he looked
  </p>
  <p>
   like the type who would have been valedictorian of his high
  </p>
  <p>
   school (he was), a National Merit Scholar (he was), and a magna
  </p>
  <p>
   cum laude graduate from a prestigious seminary (he was, from
  </p>
  <p>
   Trinity Evangelical Divinity School).
  </p>
  <p>
   But I wanted someone who was more than just intelligent and
  </p>
  <p>
   educated. I was searching for an expert who wouldn't gloss over
  </p>
  <p>
   nuances or blithely dismiss challenges to the records of
  </p>
  <p>
   Christianity. I wanted someone with integrity, someone who has
  </p>
  <p>
   grappled with the most potent critiques of the faith and who
  </p>
  <p>
   speaks authoritatively but without the kind of sweeping
  </p>
  <p>
   statements that conceal rather than deal with critical issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   I was told Blomberg was exactly what I was looking for, and I
  </p>
  <p>
   flew to Denver wondering if he could measure up. Admittedly, I
  </p>
  <p>
   had a few doubts, especially when my research yielded one
  </p>
  <p>
   profoundly disturbing  fact that he would probably have preferred
  </p>
  <p>
   had remained hidden:  Blomberg still holds out hope that his
  </p>
  <p>
   beloved childhood heroes, the Chicago Cubs, will win the World
  </p>
  <p>
   Series in his lifetime. Frankly, that was enough to make me a bit
  </p>
  <p>
   suspicious of his discernment.

  <h2>
   THE FIRST INTERVIEW. CRAIG L. BLOMBERG, PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Craig Blomberg is widely considered to be one of the country's
  </p>
  <p>
   foremost  authorities on the biographies of Jesus, which are
  </p>
  <p>
   called the four gospels. He received his doctorate in New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament from Aberdeen University in Scotland, later serving as
  </p>
  <p>
   a senior research fellow at Tyndale House at Cambridge University
  </p>
  <p>
   in England, where he was part of an elite group of international
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars that produced a series of acclaimed works on Jesus. For
  </p>
  <p>
   the last dozen years he has been a professor of New Testament at
  </p>
  <p>
   the highly respected Denver Seminary.
