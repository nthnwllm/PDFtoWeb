  <p>
   stabbing of Jesus by the Roman soldier that foiled his
  </p>
  <p>
   complicated scheme to escape the cross alive, even though
  </p>
  <p>
   Schonfield conceded, "We are nowhere claiming ... that [the book]
  </p>
  <p>
   represents what actually happened."
  </p>
  <p>
   The swoon hypothesis popped up again in Donovan Joyce's 1972 book
  </p>
  <p>
   The Jesus Scroll, which "contains an even more incredible string
  </p>
  <p>
   of improbabilities than Schonfield's," according to Resurrection
  </p>
  <p>
   expert Gary Habermas. In 1982 Holy Blood, Holy Grail added the
  </p>
  <p>
   twist that Pontius Pilate had been bribed to allow Jesus to be
  </p>
  <p>
   taken down from the cross before he was dead. Even so, the
  </p>
  <p>
   authors confessed, "We could not-and still cannot-prove the
  </p>
  <p>
   accuracy of our conclusion."
  </p>
  <p>
   As recently as 1992 a little-known academic from Australia,
  </p>
  <p>
   Barbara  Thiering, caused a stir by reviving the swoon theory in
  </p>
  <p>
   her book Jesus and the Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which was
  </p>
  <p>
   introduced with much fanfare by a well-respected U.S. publisher
  </p>
  <p>
   and then derisively  dismissed by Emory University scholar Luke
  </p>
  <p>
   Timothy Johnson as being "the purest poppycock, the product of
  </p>
  <p>
   fevered imagination rather than careful analysis."
  </p>
  <p>
   Like an urban myth, the swoon theory continues to flourish. I
  </p>
  <p>
   hear it all the time in discussing the Resurrection with
  </p>
  <p>
   spiritual seekers. But what does the evidence really establish?
  </p>
  <p>
   What actually happened at the Crucifixion? What was Jesus' cause
  </p>
  <p>
   of death? Is there any possible  way he could have survived this
  </p>
  <p>
   ordeal? Those are the kinds of questions that I hoped medical
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence could help resolve. So I flew to southern California and
  </p>
  <p>
   knocked on the door of a prominent physician who has extensively
  </p>
  <p>
   studied the historical, archaeological, and medical data
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning the death of Jesus of Nazareth-although it seems that,
  </p>
  <p>
   due to the mysteriously missing body, no autopsy has ever been
  </p>
  <p>
   performed.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE TENTH INTERVIEW: ALEXANDER METHERELL, M.D., PH.D.
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The plush setting was starkly incongruous with the subject we
  </p>
  <p>
   were discussing. There we were, sitting in the living room of
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell's comfortable California home on a balmy spring
  </p>
  <p>
   evening, warm ocean breezes whispering through the windows, while
  </p>
  <p>
   we were talking about a topic of unimaginable brutality: a
  </p>
  <p>
   beating so barbarous that it shocks the conscience, and a form of
  </p>
  <p>
   capital punishment so depraved that it stands as wretched
  </p>
  <p>
   testimony to man's inhumanity to man. I had sought out Metherell
  </p>
  <p>
   because I heard he possessed the medical and scientific
  </p>
  <p>
   credentials to explain the Crucifixion. But I also had another
  </p>
  <p>
   motivation: I had been told he could discuss the topic
  </p>
  <p>
   dispassionately as well as accurately. That was important to me,
  </p>
  <p>
   because I wanted the facts to speak for themselves, without the
  </p>
  <p>
   hyperbole or charged language that might otherwise manipulate
  </p>
  <p>
   emotions.
  </p>
  <p>
   As you would expect from someone with a medical degree
  </p>
  <p>
   (University  of Miami in Florida) and a doctorate in engineering
  </p>
  <p>
   (University of Bristol in England), Metherell speaks with
  </p>
  <p>
   scientific precision. He is board certified in diagnosis by the
  </p>
  <p>
   American Board of Radiology and has been a consultant to the
  </p>
  <p>
   National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National
  </p>
  <p>
   Institutes of Health of Bethesda, Maryland. A former research
  </p>
  <p>
   scientist who has taught at the University of California,
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell is editor of five scientific books and has written for
  </p>
  <p>
   publications ranging from Aerospace Medicine to Scientific
  </p>
  <p>
   American.  His ingenious analysis of muscular contraction has
  </p>
  <p>
   been published  in The Physiologist and Biophysics Journal. He
  </p>
  <p>
   even looks the role of a distinguished medical authority: he's an
  </p>
  <p>
   imposing figure with silver hair and a courteous yet formal
  </p>
  <p>
   demeanor.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'll be honest: at times I wondered what was going on inside
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell. With scientific reserve, speaking slowly and
  </p>
  <p>
   methodically, he gave no hint of any inner turmoil as he calmly
  </p>
  <p>
   described the chilling  details of Jesus' demise. Whatever was
  </p>
  <p>
   going on underneath, whatever distress it caused him as a
  </p>
  <p>
   Christian to talk about the cruel fate that befell Jesus, he was
  </p>
  <p>
   able to mask with a professionalism born out of decades of
  </p>
  <p>
   laboratory research.
  </p>
  <p>
   He just gave me the facts-and after all, that was what I had
  </p>
  <p>
   traveled  halfway across the country to get.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE TORTURE BEFORE THE CROSS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Initially I wanted to elicit from Metherell a basic description
  </p>
  <p>
   of the events leading up to Jesus' death. So after a time of
  </p>
  <p>
   social chat, I put down my iced tea and shifted in my chair to
  </p>
  <p>
   face him squarely. "Could you paint a picture of what happened to
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   He cleared his throat. "It began after the Last Supper," he said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Jesus went with his disciples to the Mount of Olives-
  </p>
  <p>
   specifically, to the Garden of Gethsemane. And there, if you
  </p>
  <p>
   remember, he prayed all night. Now, during that process he was
  </p>
  <p>
   anticipating the coming events of the next day. Since he knew the
  </p>
  <p>
   amount of suffering he was going to have to endure, he was quite
  </p>
  <p>
   naturally experiencing a great deal of psychological stress."
  </p>
  <p>
   I raised my hand to stop him. "Whoa-here's where skeptics
  </p>
  <p>
   have a field day," I told him. "The gospels tell us he began to
  </p>
  <p>
   sweat blood at this point. Now, come on, isn't that just a
  </p>
  <p>
   product of some overactive  imaginations? Doesn't that call into
  </p>
  <p>
   question the accuracy of the gospel writers?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfazed, Metherell shook his head. "Not at all," he replied.
  </p>
  <p>
   "This is a known medical condition called hematidrosis. It's not
  </p>
  <p>
   very common,  but it is associated with a high degree of
  </p>
  <p>
   psychological stress. What happens is that severe anxiety causes
  </p>
  <p>
   the release of chemicals  that break down the capillaries in the
  </p>
  <p>
   sweat glands. As a result, there's a small amount of bleeding
  </p>
  <p>
   into these glands, and the sweat comes out tinged with blood.
  </p>
  <p>
   We're not talking about a lot of blood; it's just a very, very
  </p>
  <p>
   small amount."
  </p>
  <p>
   Though a bit chastened, I pressed on. "Did this have any other
  </p>
  <p>
   effect on the body?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "What this did was set up the skin to be extremely fragile so
  </p>
  <p>
   that when Jesus was flogged by the Roman soldier the next day,
  </p>
  <p>
   his skin would be very, very sensitive."
  </p>
  <p>
   Well, I thought, here we go. I braced myself for the
  </p>
  <p>
   grim images I knew were about to flood my mind. I had seen plenty
  </p>
  <p>
   of dead bodies  as a journalist-casualties of car accidents,
  </p>
  <p>
   fires, and crime syndicate  retribution-but there was something
  </p>
  <p>
   especially unnerving in hearing about someone being intentionally
  </p>
  <p>
   brutalized by executioners  determined to extract maximum
  </p>
  <p>
   suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Tell me," I said, "what was the flogging like?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell's eyes never left me. "Roman floggings were known to be
  </p>
  <p>
   terribly brutal. They usually consisted of thirty-nine lashes but
  </p>
  <p>
   frequently were a lot more than that, depending on the mood of
  </p>
  <p>
   the soldier applying the blows.
  </p>
  <p>
   The soldier would use a whip of braided leather thongs with metal
  </p>
  <p>
   balls woven into them. When the whip would strike the flesh,
  </p>
  <p>
   these balls would cause deep bruises or contusions, which would
  </p>
  <p>
   break open with further blows. And the whip had pieces of sharp
  </p>
  <p>
   bone as well, which would cut the flesh severely.
  </p>
  <p>
   The back would be so shredded that part of the spine was
  </p>
  <p>
   sometimes  exposed by the deep, deep cuts. The whipping would
  </p>
  <p>
   have gone all the way from the shoulders down to the back, the
  </p>
  <p>
   buttocks, and the back of the legs. It was just terrible."
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell paused. "Go on," I said.
  </p>
  <p>
   "One physician who has studied Roman beatings said, 'As the
  </p>
  <p>
   flogging continued, the lacerations would tear into the
  </p>
  <p>
   underlying skeletal muscles and produce quivering ribbons of
  </p>
  <p>
   bleeding flesh.' A third-century historian by the name of
  </p>
  <p>
   Eusebius described a flogging by saying, 'The sufferer's veins
  </p>
  <p>
   were laid bare, and the very muscles, sinews, and bowels of the
  </p>
  <p>
   victim were open to exposure.'
  </p>
  <p>
   We know that many people would die from this kind of beating even
  </p>
  <p>
   before they could be crucified. At the least, the victim would
  </p>
  <p>
   experience tremendous pain and go into hypovolemic shock."
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell had thrown in a medical term I didn't know. "What does
  </p>
  <p>
   hypovolemic shock mean?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Hypo means 'low,' vol refers to volume, and emic means 'blood,'
  </p>
  <p>
   so hypovolemic shock means the person is suffering the effects of
  </p>
  <p>
   losing  a large amount of blood," the doctor explained. "This
  </p>
  <p>
   does four things. First, the heart races to try to pump blood
  </p>
  <p>
   that isn't there; second,  the blood pressure drops, causing
  </p>
  <p>
   fainting or collapse; third, the kidneys stop producing urine to
  </p>
  <p>
   maintain what volume is left; and fourth, the person becomes very
  </p>
  <p>
   thirsty as the body craves fluids to replace the lost blood
  </p>
  <p>
   volume."
  </p>
  <p>
   Do you see evidence of this in the gospel accounts?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, most definitely," he replied. "Jesus was in hypovolemic
  </p>
  <p>
   shock as he staggered up the road to the execution site at
  </p>
  <p>
   Calvary, carrying the horizontal beam of the cross. Finally Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   collapsed, and the Roman soldier ordered Simon to carry the cross
  </p>
  <p>
   for him. Later we read that Jesus said, 'I thirst,' at which
  </p>
  <p>
   point a sip of vinegar was offered to him.
  </p>
  <p>
   Because of the terrible effects of this beating, there's no

  <h2>
   THE AGONY OF THE CROSS
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   As distasteful as the description of the flogging was, I knew
  </p>
  <p>
   that even more repugnant testimony was yet to come. That's
  </p>
  <p>
   because historians are unanimous that Jesus survived the beating
  </p>
  <p>
   that day and went on to the cross-which is where the real issue
  </p>
  <p>
   lies.
  </p>
  <p>
   These days when condemned criminals are strapped down and
  </p>
  <p>
   injected with poisons, or secured to a wooden chair and subjected
  </p>
  <p>
   to a surge of electricity, the circumstances are highly
  </p>
  <p>
   controlled. Death comes quickly and predictably. Medical
  </p>
  <p>
   examiners carefully certify the victim's passing. From close
  </p>
  <p>
   proximity witnesses scrutinize everything  from beginning to end.
  </p>
  <p>
   But how certain was death by this crude, slow, and rather inexact
  </p>
  <p>
   form of execution called crucifixion? In fact, most people aren't
  </p>
  <p>
   sure how the cross kills its victims. And without a trained
  </p>
  <p>
   medical examiner to officially attest that Jesus had died, might
  </p>
  <p>
   he have, escaped the experience brutalized and bleeding but
  </p>
  <p>
   nevertheless alive?
  </p>
  <p>
   I began to unpack these issues. "What happened when he arrived at
  </p>
  <p>
   the site of the Crucifixion?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "He would have been laid down, and his hands would have been
  </p>
  <p>
   nailed in the outstretched position to the horizontal beam. This
  </p>
  <p>
   crossbar  was called the patibulum, and at this stage it was
  </p>
  <p>
   separate from the vertical beam, which was permanently set in the
  </p>
  <p>
   ground." I was having difficulty visualizing this; I needed more
  </p>
  <p>
   details. "Nailed with what?" I asked. "Nailed where?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "The Romans used spikes that were five to seven inches long and
  </p>
  <p>
   tapered to a sharp point. They were driven through the wrists,"
  </p>
  <p>
   Metherell said, pointing about an inch or so below his left palm.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Hold it," I interrupted. "I thought the nails pierced his palms.
  </p>
  <p>
   That's what all the paintings show. In fact, it's become a
  </p>
  <p>
   standard symbol  representing the Crucifixion."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Through the wrists," Metherell repeated. "This was a solid
  </p>
  <p>
   position  that would lock the hand; if the nails had been driven
  </p>
  <p>
   through the palms, his weight would have caused the skin to tear
  </p>
  <p>
   and he would have fallen off the cross. So the nails went through
  </p>
  <p>
   the wrists, although this was considered part of the hand in the
  </p>
  <p>
   language of the day. And it's important to understand that the
  </p>
  <p>
   nail would go through the place where the median nerve runs. This
  </p>
  <p>
   is the largest nerve going out to the hand, and it would be
  </p>
  <p>
   crushed by the nail that was being poundedin."
  </p>
  <p>
   Since I have only a rudimentary knowledge of the human
  </p>
  <p>
   anatomy, I wasn't sure what this meant. "What sort of pain would
  </p>
  <p>
   that have produced?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Let me put it this way," he replied. "Do you know the kind of
