  <p>
   that others cannot witness it."
  </p>
  <p>
   "That," said Habermas, "is a big problem for the hallucination
  </p>
  <p>
   theory, since there are repeated accounts of Jesus appearing to
  </p>
  <p>
   multiple  people who reported the same thing.
  </p>
  <p>
   And there are several other arguments why hallucinations can't
  </p>
  <p>
   explain away his appearances," he continued. "The disciples were
  </p>
  <p>
   fearful, doubtful, and in despair after the Crucifixion, whereas
  </p>
  <p>
   people who hallucinate need a fertile mind of expectancy or
  </p>
  <p>
   anticipation. Peter was hardheaded, for goodness' sake; James was
  </p>
  <p>
   a skeptic-certainly  not good candidates for hallucinations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Also, hallucinations are comparably rare. They're usually
  </p>
  <p>
   caused by drugs or bodily deprivation. Chances are, you don't
  </p>
  <p>
   know anybody who's ever had a hallucination not caused by one of
  </p>
  <p>
   those two things. Yet we're supposed to believe that over a
  </p>
  <p>
   course of many weeks, people from all sorts of backgrounds, all
  </p>
  <p>
   kinds of temperaments,  in various places, all experienced
  </p>
  <p>
   hallucinations? That strains the hypothesis quite a bit, doesn't
  </p>
  <p>
   it?
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides, if we establish the gospel accounts as being reliable,
  </p>
  <p>
   how do you account for the disciples eating with Jesus and
  </p>
  <p>
   touching him? How does he walk along with two of them on the road
  </p>
  <p>
   to Emmaus? And what about the empty tomb? If people only thought
  </p>
  <p>
   they saw Jesus, his body would still be in his grave."
  </p>
  <p>
   OK, I thought, if it wasn't a hallucination, maybe it was
  </p>
  <p>
   something  more subtle.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Could this have been an example of group think, in which people
  </p>
  <p>
   talk each other into seeing something that doesn't exist?" I
  </p>
  <p>
   asked. "As Michael Martin observed, 'A person full of religious
  </p>
  <p>
   zeal may see what he or she wants to see, not what is really
  </p>
  <p>
   there.""O
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas laughed. "You know, one of the atheists I debated,
  </p>
  <p>
   Antony Flew, told me he doesn't like it when other atheists use
  </p>
  <p>
   that last argument, because it cuts both ways. As Flew said,
  </p>
  <p>
   'Christians believe because they want to, but atheists don't
  </p>
  <p>
   believe because they don't want to!'
  </p>
  <p>
   Actually, there are several reasons why the disciples couldn't
  </p>
  <p>
   have talked each other into this. As the center of their faith,
  </p>
  <p>
   there was too much at stake; they went to their deaths defending
  </p>
  <p>
   it. Wouldn't some of them rethink the group think at a later date
  </p>
  <p>
   and recant or just quietly fall away? And what about James, who
  </p>
  <p>
   didn't believe in Jesus, and Paul, who was a persecutor of
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians-how did they get talked into seeing something?
  </p>
  <p>
   Further, what about the empty tomb?
  </p>
  <p>
   And on top of that, this view doesn't account for the forthright
  </p>
  <p>
   language of sight in the I Corinthians 15 creed and other
  </p>
  <p>
   passages. The eyewitnesses were at least convinced that they had
  </p>
  <p>
   seen Jesus alive, and group think doesn't explain this aspect
  </p>
  <p>
   very well." Habermas paused long enough to pull out a book and
  </p>
  <p>
   cap his
  </p>
  <p>
   argument with a quote from prominent theologian and historian
  </p>
  <p>
   Carl Braaten: "Even the more skeptical historians agree that for
  </p>
  <p>
   primitive Christianity ... the resurrection of Jesus from the
  </p>
  <p>
   dead was a real event in history, the very foundation of faith,
  </p>
  <p>
   and not a mythical idea ansing out of the creative imagination of
  </p>
  <p>
   believers.'"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Sometimes," concluded Habermas, "people just grasp at straws
  </p>
  <p>
   trying to account for the appearances. But nothing fits all the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence  better than the explanation that Jesus was alive."
  </p>
  <h2>
   "NO RATIONAL DOUBT"
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Jesus was killed on the cross-Alexander Metherell has made that
  </p>
  <p>
   graphically clear. His tomb was empty on Easter Morning-William
  </p>
  <p>
   Lane Craig left no doubt about that. His disciples and others saw
  </p>
  <p>
   him, touched him, and ate with him after the Resurrection-Gary
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas has built that case with abundant evidence. As prominent
  </p>
  <p>
   British theologian  Michael Green said, "The appearances of Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   are as well
  </p>
  <p>
   authenticated as anything in antiquity... There can be no
  </p>
  <p>
   rational doubt that they occurred, and that the main reason why
  </p>
  <p>
   Christians became sure of the resurrection in the earliest days
  </p>
  <p>
   was just this. They could say with assurance, 'We have seen the
  </p>
  <p>
   Lord.' They knew it was he. And all this doesn't even exhaust the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence. I had already made plane reservations for a trip to the
  </p>
  <p>
   other side of the country to interview one more expert on the
  </p>
  <p>
   final category of proof that the Resurrection  is a real event of
  </p>
  <p>
   history.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before I left Habermas's office, however, I had one more
  </p>
  <p>
   question.  Frankly, I hesitated to ask it, because it was a bit
  </p>
  <p>
   too predictable and I thought I'd get an answer that was a little
  </p>
  <p>
   too pat.
  </p>
  <p>
   The question concerned the importance of the Resurrection. I
  </p>
  <p>
   figured  if I asked Habermas about that, he'd give the standard
  </p>
  <p>
   reply about it being at the center of Christian doctrine, the
  </p>
  <p>
   axis around which the Christian faith turned. And I was right-he
  </p>
  <p>
   did give a stock answer like that.
  </p>
  <p>
   But what surprised me was that this wasn't all he said. This
  </p>
  <p>
   nutsand-bolts  scholar, this burly and straight-shooting debater,
  </p>
  <p>
   this combat-ready  defender of the faith, allowed me to peer into
  </p>
  <p>
   his soul as he gave an answer that grew out of the deepest valley
  </p>
  <p>
   of despair he had ever walked through.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE RESURRECTION OF DEBBIE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Habermas rubbed his graying beard. The quick-fire cadence and
  </p>
  <p>
   debater's edge to his voice were gone. No more quoting of
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars, no more citing of Scripture, no more building a case. I
  </p>
  <p>
   had asked about the importance of the Resurrection, and Habermas
  </p>
  <p>
   decided to take a risk by harkening back to 1995, when his wife,
  </p>
  <p>
   Debbie, slowly died of stomach cancer. Caught off guard by the
  </p>
  <p>
   tenderness of the moment, all I could do was listen.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I sat on our porch," he began, looking off to the side at
  </p>
  <p>
   nothing in particular. He sighed deeply, then went on. "My wife
  </p>
  <p>
   was upstairs dying. Except for a few weeks, she was home through
  </p>
  <p>
   it all. It was an awful time. This was the worst thing that could
  </p>
  <p>
   possibly happen." He turned and looked straight at me. "But do
  </p>
  <p>
   you know what was amazing? My students would call me-not just one
  </p>
  <p>
   but several of them-and say, 'At a time like this, aren't you
  </p>
  <p>
   glad about the Resurrection?'  As sober as those circumstances
  </p>
  <p>
   were, I had to smile for two reasons. First, my students were
  </p>
  <p>
   trying to cheer me up with my own teaching. And second, it
  </p>
  <p>
   worked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "As I would sit there, I'd picture Job, who went through all that
  </p>
  <p>
   terrible stuff and asked questions of God, but then God turned
  </p>
  <p>
   the tables and asked him a few questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   I knew if God were to come to me, I'd ask only one question:
  </p>
  <p>
   'Lord, why is Debbie up there in bed?' And I think God would
  </p>
  <p>
   respond by asking gently, 'Gary, did I raise my Son from the
  </p>
  <p>
   dead?' I'd say, 'Come on, Lord, I've written seven books on that
  </p>
  <p>
   topic! Of course he was raised from the dead. But I want to know
  </p>
  <p>
   about Debbie!' "I think he'd keep coming back to the same
  </p>
  <p>
   question-'Did I
  </p>
  <p>
   raise my Son from the dead?'  'Did I raise my Son from the
  </p>
  <p>
   dead?'until  I got his point: the Resurrection says that if Jesus
  </p>
  <p>
   was raised two thousand years ago, there's an answer to Debbie's
  </p>
  <p>
   death in 1995. And do you know what? It worked for me while I was
  </p>
  <p>
   sitting on the porch, and it still works today.
  </p>
  <p>
   It was a horribly emotional time for me, but I couldn't get
  </p>
  <p>
   around the fact that the Resurrection is the answer for her
  </p>
  <p>
   suffering. I still worried; I still wondered what I'd do raising
  </p>
  <p>
   four kids alone. But there wasn't a time when that truth didn't
  </p>
  <p>
   comfort me.
  </p>
  <p>
   Losing my wife was the most painful experience I've ever had to
  </p>
  <p>
   face, but if the Resurrection could get me through that, it can
  </p>
  <p>
   get me through anything. It was good for 30 A.D., it's good for
  </p>
  <p>
   1995, it's good for 1998, and it's good beyond that."
  </p>
  <p>
   Habermas locked eyes with mine. "That's not some sermon," he said
  </p>
  <p>
   quietly. "I believe that with all my heart. If there's a
  </p>
  <p>
   resurrection,  there's a heaven. If Jesus was raised, Debbie was
  </p>
  <p>
   raised. And I will be someday, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then I'll see them both."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations
  </p>
  <p>
   Questions forReflection or Group Study
  </p>
  <p>
   1.  Habermas reduced the issue of the Resurrection down to two
  </p>
  <p>
   questions:  Did Jesus die? And was he later seen alive? Based on
  </p>
  <p>
   the
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence so far, how would you answer those questions and why? 2.
  </p>
  <p>
   How influential is the I Corinthians 15 creed in your assessment
  </p>
  <p>
   of whether Jesus was seen alive? What are your reasons for
  </p>
  <p>
   concluding  that it's significant or insignificant in your
  </p>
  <p>
   investigation? 3.  Spend a few minutes to look up some of the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel appearances cited by Habermas. Do they have the ring of
  </p>
  <p>
   truth to you? How would you evaluate them as evidence for the
  </p>
  <p>
   Resurrection?
  </p>
  <p>
   4.  Habermas spoke about how the Resurrection had a personal
  </p>
  <p>
   meaning  for him. Have you faced a loss in your life? How would
  </p>

   14: THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <p>
   Are There Any Supporting Facts That Point to the Resurrection? No
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses watched Timothy McVeigh load two tons of fertilizer-
  </p>
  <p>
   based explosives into a Ryder rental truck. Nobody saw him drive
  </p>
  <p>
   the vehicle to the front of the federal building in Oklahoma City
  </p>
  <p>
   and detonate the bomb, killing 168 people. No video camera
  </p>
  <p>
   captured an image of him fleeing the scene.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet a jury was able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that
  </p>
  <p>
   McVeigh was guilty of the worst act of domestic terrorism in U.S.
  </p>
  <p>
   history.  Why? Because fact by fact, exhibit by exhibit, witness
  </p>
  <p>
   by witness,  prosecutors used circumstantial evidence to build an
  </p>
  <p>
   airtight case against him.
  </p>
  <p>
   While none of the 137 people called to the witness stand had seen
  </p>
  <p>
   McVeigh commit the crime, their testimony did provide indirect
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence of his guilt: a businessman said McVeigh rented a Ryder
  </p>
  <p>
   truck, a friend said McVeigh talked about bombing the building
  </p>
  <p>
   out of anger against the government, and a scientist said
  </p>
  <p>
   McVeigh's clothes contained a residue of explosives when he was
  </p>
  <p>
   arrested. Prosecutors buttressed this with more than seven
  </p>
  <p>
   hundred
  </p>
  <p>
   exhibits, ranging from motel and taxi receipts to telephone
  </p>
  <p>
   records to a truck key to a bill from a Chinese restaurant. Over
  </p>
  <p>
   e.ighteen days they skillfully wove a convincing web of evidence
  </p>
  <p>
   from which McVeigh was woefully unable to extricate himself.
  </p>
  <p>
   Eyewitness testimony is called direct evidence because people
  </p>
  <p>
   describe under oath how they personally saw the defendant commit
  </p>
  <p>
   the crime. While this is often compelling, it can sometimes be
  </p>
  <p>
   subject to faded memories, prejudices, and even outright
  </p>
  <p>
   fabrication.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   In contrast. circumstantial evidence is made up of indirect facts
  </p>
  <p>
   from which inferences  can be rationally drawn. Its cumulative
  </p>
  <p>
   effect can be every bit as strong-and in many instances even more
  </p>
  <p>
   potent-than eyewitness  accounts.
