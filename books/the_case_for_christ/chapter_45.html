   that others cannot witness it." "That," said Habermas, "is a big problem for the hallucination theory, since there are repeated accounts of Jesus appearing to multiple  people who reported the same thing. And there are several other arguments why hallucinations can't explain away his appearances," he continued. "The disciples were fearful, doubtful, and in despair after the Crucifixion, whereas people who hallucinate need a fertile mind of expectancy or anticipation. Peter was hardheaded, for goodness' sake; James was a skeptic-certainly  not good candidates for hallucinations. Also, hallucinations are comparably rare. They're usually caused by drugs or bodily deprivation. Chances are, you don't know anybody who's ever had a hallucination not caused by one of those two things. Yet we're supposed to believe that over a course of many weeks, people from all sorts of backgrounds, all kinds of temperaments,  in various places, all experienced hallucinations? That strains the hypothesis quite a bit, doesn't it? Besides, if we establish the gospel accounts as being reliable, how do you account for the disciples eating with Jesus and touching him? How does he walk along with two of them on the road to Emmaus? And what about the empty tomb? If people only thought they saw Jesus, his body would still be in his grave." OK, I thought, if it wasn't a hallucination, maybe it was something  more subtle. "Could this have been an example of group think, in which people talk each other into seeing something that doesn't exist?" I asked. "As Michael Martin observed, 'A person full of religious zeal may see what he or she wants to see, not what is really there.""O Habermas laughed. "You know, one of the atheists I debated, Antony Flew, told me he doesn't like it when other atheists use that last argument, because it cuts both ways. As Flew said, 'Christians believe because they want to, but atheists don't believe because they don't want to!' Actually, there are several reasons why the disciples couldn't have talked each other into this. As the center of their faith, there was too much at stake; they went to their deaths defending it. Wouldn't some of them rethink the group think at a later date and recant or just quietly fall away? And what about James, who didn't believe in Jesus, and Paul, who was a persecutor of Christians-how did they get talked into seeing something? Further, what about the empty tomb? And on top of that, this view doesn't account for the forthright language of sight in the I Corinthians 15 creed and other passages. The eyewitnesses were at least convinced that they had seen Jesus alive, and group think doesn't explain this aspect very well." Habermas paused long enough to pull out a book and cap his argument with a quote from prominent theologian and historian Carl Braaten: "Even the more skeptical historians agree that for primitive Christianity ... the resurrection of Jesus from the dead was a real event in history, the very foundation of faith, and not a mythical idea ansing out of the creative imagination of believers.'" "Sometimes," concluded Habermas, "people just grasp at straws trying to account for the appearances. But nothing fits all the evidence  better than the explanation that Jesus was alive."
  </p>
  <h2>
   "NO RATIONAL DOUBT"
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Jesus was killed on the cross-Alexander Metherell has made that graphically clear. His tomb was empty on Easter Morning-William Lane Craig left no doubt about that. His disciples and others saw him, touched him, and ate with him after the Resurrection-Gary Habermas has built that case with abundant evidence. As prominent British theologian  Michael Green said, "The appearances of Jesus are as well authenticated as anything in antiquity... There can be no rational doubt that they occurred, and that the main reason why Christians became sure of the resurrection in the earliest days was just this. They could say with assurance, 'We have seen the Lord.' They knew it was he. And all this doesn't even exhaust the evidence. I had already made plane reservations for a trip to the other side of the country to interview one more expert on the final category of proof that the Resurrection  is a real event of history. Before I left Habermas's office, however, I had one more question.  Frankly, I hesitated to ask it, because it was a bit too predictable and I thought I'd get an answer that was a little too pat. The question concerned the importance of the Resurrection. I figured  if I asked Habermas about that, he'd give the standard reply about it being at the center of Christian doctrine, the axis around which the Christian faith turned. And I was right-he did give a stock answer like that. But what surprised me was that this wasn't all he said. This nutsand-bolts  scholar, this burly and straight-shooting debater, this combat-ready  defender of the faith, allowed me to peer into his soul as he gave an answer that grew out of the deepest valley of despair he had ever walked through.
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE RESURRECTION OF DEBBIE
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Habermas rubbed his graying beard. The quick-fire cadence and debater's edge to his voice were gone. No more quoting of scholars, no more citing of Scripture, no more building a case. I had asked about the importance of the Resurrection, and Habermas decided to take a risk by harkening back to 1995, when his wife, Debbie, slowly died of stomach cancer. Caught off guard by the tenderness of the moment, all I could do was listen. "I sat on our porch," he began, looking off to the side at nothing in particular. He sighed deeply, then went on. "My wife was upstairs dying. Except for a few weeks, she was home through it all. It was an awful time. This was the worst thing that could possibly happen." He turned and looked straight at me. "But do you know what was amazing? My students would call me-not just one but several of them-and say, 'At a time like this, aren't you glad about the Resurrection?'  As sober as those circumstances were, I had to smile for two reasons. First, my students were trying to cheer me up with my own teaching. And second, it worked. "As I would sit there, I'd picture Job, who went through all that terrible stuff and asked questions of God, but then God turned the tables and asked him a few questions. I knew if God were to come to me, I'd ask only one question: 'Lord, why is Debbie up there in bed?' And I think God would respond by asking gently, 'Gary, did I raise my Son from the dead?' I'd say, 'Come on, Lord, I've written seven books on that topic! Of course he was raised from the dead. But I want to know about Debbie!' "I think he'd keep coming back to the same question-'Did I raise my Son from the dead?'  'Did I raise my Son from the dead?'until  I got his point: the Resurrection says that if Jesus was raised two thousand years ago, there's an answer to Debbie's death in 1995. And do you know what? It worked for me while I was sitting on the porch, and it still works today. It was a horribly emotional time for me, but I couldn't get around the fact that the Resurrection is the answer for her suffering. I still worried; I still wondered what I'd do raising four kids alone. But there wasn't a time when that truth didn't comfort me. Losing my wife was the most painful experience I've ever had to face, but if the Resurrection could get me through that, it can get me through anything. It was good for 30 A.D., it's good for 1995, it's good for 1998, and it's good beyond that." Habermas locked eyes with mine. "That's not some sermon," he said quietly. "I believe that with all my heart. If there's a resurrection,  there's a heaven. If Jesus was raised, Debbie was raised. And I will be someday, too. Then I'll see them both."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Deliberations Questions forReflection or Group Study 1.  Habermas reduced the issue of the Resurrection down to two questions:  Did Jesus die? And was he later seen alive? Based on the evidence so far, how would you answer those questions and why? 2. How influential is the I Corinthians 15 creed in your assessment of whether Jesus was seen alive? What are your reasons for concluding  that it's significant or insignificant in your investigation? 3.  Spend a few minutes to look up some of the gospel appearances cited by Habermas. Do they have the ring of truth to you? How would you evaluate them as evidence for the Resurrection? 4.  Habermas spoke about how the Resurrection had a personal meaning  for him. Have you faced a loss in your life? How would belief in the Resurrection affect the way you view it?

  <h2>
   14: THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
  </h2>
  <p>
   Are There Any Supporting Facts That Point to the Resurrection? No witnesses watched Timothy McVeigh load two tons of fertilizer- based explosives into a Ryder rental truck. Nobody saw him drive the vehicle to the front of the federal building in Oklahoma City and detonate the bomb, killing 168 people. No video camera captured an image of him fleeing the scene. Yet a jury was able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that McVeigh was guilty of the worst act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.  Why? Because fact by fact, exhibit by exhibit, witness by witness,  prosecutors used circumstantial evidence to build an airtight case against him. While none of the 137 people called to the witness stand had seen McVeigh commit the crime, their testimony did provide indirect evidence of his guilt: a businessman said McVeigh rented a Ryder truck, a friend said McVeigh talked about bombing the building out of anger against the government, and a scientist said McVeigh's clothes contained a residue of explosives when he was arrested. Prosecutors buttressed this with more than seven hundred exhibits, ranging from motel and taxi receipts to telephone records to a truck key to a bill from a Chinese restaurant. Over e.ighteen days they skillfully wove a convincing web of evidence from which McVeigh was woefully unable to extricate himself. Eyewitness testimony is called direct evidence because people describe under oath how they personally saw the defendant commit the crime. While this is often compelling, it can sometimes be subject to faded memories, prejudices, and even outright fabrication.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   In contrast. circumstantial evidence is made up of indirect facts from which inferences  can be rationally drawn. Its cumulative effect can be every bit as strong-and in many instances even more potent-than eyewitness  accounts.
