  <p>
   replying in quaint phrases like "Quite so," he continues to
  </p>
  <p>
   remain on the cutting edge of New Testament scholarship. When I
  </p>
  <p>
   asked for some statistics, he didn't rely on the numbers in his
  </p>
  <p>
   1992 book on the New Testament; he had conducted fresh research
  </p>
  <p>
   to get up-to-date  figures. His quick mind has no problem
  </p>
  <p>
   recalling details of people and places, and he's fully conversant
  </p>
  <p>
   with all the current debates among New Testament experts. In
  </p>
  <p>
   fact, they continue to look to him for insight and wisdom.
  </p>
  <p>
   His office, about the size of a jail cell, is windowless and
  </p>
  <p>
   painted institutional gray. It has two wooden chairs; he insisted
  </p>
  <p>
   I take the more comfortable one. That was part of his charm. He
  </p>
  <p>
   was thoroughly kind, surprisingly modest and self-effacing, with
  </p>
  <p>
   a gentle spirit that made me want to someday grow old with the
  </p>
  <p>
   same mellow kind of grace. We got acquainted with each other for
  </p>
  <p>
   a while, and then I turned to the first issue I wanted to
  </p>
  <p>
   address: how can we be sure the biographies  of Jesus were handed
  </p>
  <p>
   down to us in a reliable way?
  </p>
  <h2>
   COPIES OF COPIES OF COPIES
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "I'll be honest with you," I said to Metzger. "When I first found
  </p>
  <p>
   out that there are no surviving originals of the New Testament, I
  </p>
  <p>
   was really skeptical. I thought, If all we have are copies of
  </p>
  <p>
   copies of copies, how can I have any confidence that the New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament we have today bears any resemblance whatsoever to what
  </p>
  <p>
   was originally written? How do you respond to that?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "This isn't an issue that's unique to the Bible; it's a question
  </p>
  <p>
   we can ask of other documents that have come down to us from
  </p>
  <p>
   antiquity,"  he replied. "But what the New Testament has in its
  </p>
  <p>
   favor, especially  when compared with other ancient writings, is
  </p>
  <p>
   the
  </p>
  <p>
   unprecedented multiplicity of copies that have survived."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Why is that important?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Well, the more often you have copies that agree with each other,
  </p>
  <p>
   especially if they emerge from different geographical areas, the
  </p>
  <p>
   more you can cross-check them to figure out what the original
  </p>
  <p>
   document was like. The only way they'd agree would be where they
  </p>
  <p>
   went back genealogically in a family tree that represents the
  </p>
  <p>
   descent of the manuscripts."
  </p>
  <p>
   "OK," I said, "I can see that having a lot of copies from various
  </p>
  <p>
   places can help. But what about the age of the documents?
  </p>
  <p>
   Certainly that's important as well, isn't it?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Quite so," he replied. "And this is something else that favors
  </p>
  <p>
   the New Testament. We have copies commencing within a couple of
  </p>
  <p>
   generations from the writing of the originals, whereas in the
  </p>
  <p>
   case of other ancient texts, maybe five, eight, or ten centuries
  </p>
  <p>
   elapsed between the original and the earliest surviving copy.
  </p>
  <p>
   "In addition to Greek manuscripts, we also have translations of
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospels into other languages at a relatively early time-into
  </p>
  <p>
   Latin, Syriac, and Coptic. And beyond that, we have what may be
  </p>
  <p>
   called secondary translations made a little later, like Armenian
  </p>
  <p>
   and Gothic. And a lot of others-Georgian, Ethiopic, a great
  </p>
  <p>
   variety."
  </p>
  <p>
   "How does that help?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Because even if we had no Greek manuscripts today, by piecing
  </p>
  <p>
   together the information from these translations from a
  </p>
  <p>
   relatively early date, we could actually reproduce the contents
  </p>
  <p>
   of the New Testament. In addition to that, even if we lost all
  </p>
  <p>
   the Greek manuscripts and the early translations, we could still
  </p>
  <p>
   reproduce the contents of the New Testament from the multiplicity
  </p>
  <p>
   of quotations in commentaries, sermons,  letters, and so forth of
  </p>
  <p>
   the early church fathers."
  </p>
  <p>
   While that seemed impressive, it was difficult to judge this
  </p>
  <p>
   evidence  in isolation. I needed some context to better
  </p>
  <p>
   appreciate the uniqueness of the New Testament. How, I wondered,
  </p>
  <p>
   did it compare with other well-known works of antiquity?
  </p>
  <h2>
   A MOUNTAIN OF MANUSCRIPTS
  </h2>
  <p>
   "When you talk about a great multiplicity of manuscripts," I
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "how does that contrast with other ancient books that are
  </p>
  <p>
   routinely accepted by scholars as being reliable? For instance,
  </p>
  <p>
   tell me about the writing of authors from about the time of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>
   Having anticipated the question, Metzger referred to some
  </p>
  <p>
   handwritten  notes he had brought along.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Consider Tacitus, the Roman historian who wrote his Annals of
  </p>
  <p>
   Imperial Rome in about A.D. 116," he began. "His first six books
  </p>
  <p>
   exist today in only one manuscript, and it was copied about A.D.
  </p>
  <p>
   850. Books eleven through sixteen are in another manuscript
  </p>
  <p>
   dating from the eleventh century. Books seven through ten are
  </p>
  <p>
   lost. So there is a long gap between the time that Tacitus sought
  </p>
  <p>
   his information and wrote it down and the only existing copies.
  </p>
  <p>
   "With regard to the first-century historian Josephus, we have
  </p>
  <p>
   nine Greek manuscripts of his work The Jewish War, and these
  </p>
  <p>
   copies were written in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
  </p>
  <p>
   centuries. There is a Latin translation from the fourth century
  </p>
  <p>
   and medieval Russian materials from the eleventh or twelfth
  </p>
  <p>
   century."
  </p>
  <p>
   Those numbers were surprising. There is but the thinnest thread
  </p>
  <p>
   of manuscripts connecting these ancient works to the modern
  </p>
  <p>
   world. "By comparison," I asked, "how many New Testament Greek
  </p>
  <p>
   manuscripts  are in existence today?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Metzger's eyes got wide. "More than five thousand have been
  </p>
  <p>
   cataloged,   he said with enthusiasm, his voice going up an
  </p>
  <p>
   octave.
  </p>
  <p>
   That was a mountain of manuscripts compared to the anthills of
  </p>
  <p>
   Tacitus and Josephus! "Is that unusual in the ancient world? What
  </p>
  <p>
   would the runner-up be?" I asked.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The quantity of New Testament material is almost embarrassing in
  </p>
  <p>
   comparison with other works of antiquity," he said. "Next to the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament, the greatest amount of manuscript testimony is of
  </p>
  <p>
   Homer's Iliad, which was the bible of the ancient Greeks. There
  </p>
  <p>
   are fewer than 650 Greek manuscripts of it today. Some are quite
  </p>
  <p>
   fragmentary.  They come down to us from the second and third
  </p>
  <p>
   century
  </p>
  <p>
   A.D. and following. When you consider that Homer composed his
  </p>
  <p>
   epic about 800 B.C., you can see there's a very lengthy gap."
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Very lengthy" was an understatement; it was a thousand years!
  </p>
  <p>
   There was in fact no comparison: the manuscript evidence for the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament was overwhelming when juxtaposed against other
  </p>
  <p>
   revered writings of antiquity-works that modern scholars have
  </p>
  <p>
   absolutely no reluctance treating as authentic.
  </p>
  <p>
   My curiosity about the New Testament manuscripts having been
  </p>
  <p>
   piqued, I asked Metzger to describe some of them for me.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The earliest are fragments of papyrus, which was a writing
  </p>
  <p>
   material  made from the papyrus plant that grew in the marshes of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Nile Delta in Egypt," he said. "There are now ninety-nine
  </p>
  <p>
   fragmentary pieces of papyrus that contain one or more passages
  </p>
  <p>
   or books of the New Testament.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The most significant to come to light are the Chester Beatty
  </p>
  <p>
   Biblical  Papyri, discovered about 1930. Of these, Beatty
  </p>
  <p>
   Biblical Papyrus number one contains portions of the four gospels
  </p>
  <p>
   and the book of Acts, and it dates from the third century.
  </p>
  <p>
   Papyrus number two contains large portions of eight letters of
  </p>
  <p>
   Paul, plus portions of Hebrews, dating to about the year 200.
  </p>
  <p>
   Papyrus number three has a sizable section of the book of
  </p>
  <p>
   Revelation, dating from the third century.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Another group of important papyrus manuscripts was purchased by
  </p>
  <p>
   a Swiss bibliophile, M. Martin Bodmer. The earliest of these,
  </p>
  <p>
   dating  from about 200, contains about two-thirds of the gospel
  </p>
  <p>
   of John. Another papyrus, containing portions of the gospels of
  </p>
  <p>
   Luke and John, dates from the third century."
  </p>
  <p>
   At this point the gap between the writing of the biographies of
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus and the earliest manuscripts was extremely small. But what
  </p>
  <p>
   is the oldest manuscript we possess? How close in time, I
  </p>
  <p>
   wondered, can we get to the original writings, which experts call
  </p>
  <p>
   "autographs"?
  </p>
  <h2>
   THE SCRAP THAT CHANGED HISTORY
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   "Of the entire New Testament," I said, "what is the earliest
  </p>
  <p>
   portion that we possess today?"
  </p>
  <p>
   Metzger didn't have to ponder the answer. "That would be a
  </p>
  <p>
   fragment  of the gospel of John, containing material from chapter
  </p>
  <p>
   eighteen.  It has five verses-three on one side, two on the
  </p>
  <p>
   other-and it measures about two and a half by three and a half
  </p>
  <p>
   inches," he said. "How was it discovered?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "It was purchased in Egypt as early as 1920, but it sat unnoticed
  </p>
  <p>
   for years among similar fragments of papyri. Then in 1934 C. H.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roberts of Saint John's College, Oxford, was sorting through the
  </p>
  <p>
   papyri at the John Rylands Library in Manchester, England. He
  </p>
  <p>
   immediately recognized this as preserving a portion of John's
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel. He was able to date it from the style of the script."
  </p>
  <p>
   "And what was his conclusion?" I asked. "How far back does it
  </p>
  <p>
   go?" "He concluded it originated between A.D. 100 to 150. Lots of
  </p>
  <p>
   other prominent paleographers, like Sir Frederic Kenyon, Sir
  </p>
  <p>
   Harold Bell, Adolf Deissmann, W, H. P. Hatch, Ulrich Wilcken, and
  </p>
  <p>
   others, have agreed with his assessment. Deissmann was convinced
  </p>
  <p>
   that it goes back at least to the reign of Emperor Hadrian, which
  </p>
  <p>
   was A.D. 117-138, or even Emperor Trajan, which was A.D. 98-117."
  </p>
  <p>
   That was a stunning discovery. The reason: skeptical German
  </p>
  <p>
   theologians  in the last century argued strenuously that the
  </p>
  <p>
   fourth gospel was not even composed until at least the year 160-
  </p>
  <p>
   too distant from the events of Jesus' life to be of much
  </p>
  <p>
   historical use. They were able to influence  generations of
  </p>
  <p>
   scholars, who scoffed at this gospel's reliability. "This
  </p>
  <p>
   certainly blows that opinion out of the water," I commented.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, it does," he said. "Here we have, at a very early date, a
  </p>
  <p>
   fragment  of a copy of John all the way over in a community along
  </p>
  <p>
   the Nile River in Egypt, far from Ephesus in Asia Minor, where
  </p>
  <p>
   the gospel was probably originally composed."
  </p>
  <p>
   This finding has literally rewritten popular views of history,
  </p>
  <p>
   pushing  the composition of John's gospel much closer to the days
  </p>
  <p>
   when Jesus walked the earth. I made a mental note to check with
  </p>
  <p>
   an archaeologist  about whether any other findings have bolstered
  </p>
  <p>
   the confidence  we can have in the fourth gospel.

   A WEALTH OF EVIDENCE
  </h2>

  <p>
   While papyrus manuscripts represent the earliest copies of the
  </p>
  <p>
   New Testament, there are also ancient copies written on
  </p>
  <p>
   parchment, which was made from the skins of cattle, sheep, goats,
  </p>
  <p>
   and antelope. "We have what are called uncial manuscripts, which
  </p>
  <p>
   are written in all-capital Greek letters," Metzger explained.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Today we have 306 of these, several dating back as early as the
  </p>
  <p>
   third century. The most important are Codex Sinaiticus, which is
  </p>
  <p>
   the only complete New Testament  in uncial letters, and Codex
  </p>
  <p>
   Vaticanus, which is not quite complete.  Both date to about A.D.
  </p>
  <p>
   350.
  </p>
  <p>
   "A new style of writing, more cursive in nature, emerged in
  </p>
  <p>
   roughly A.D. 800. It's called minuscule, and we have 2,856 of
  </p>
  <p>
   these manuscripts. Then there are also lectionaries, which
  </p>
  <p>
   contain New Testament Scripture in the sequence it was to be read
  </p>
  <p>
   in the early churches at appropriate times during the year. A
  </p>
  <p>
   total of 2,403 of these have been cataloged. That puts the grand
  </p>
  <p>
   total of Greek manuscripts  at 5,664."
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to the Greek documents, he said, there are thousands
  </p>
  <p>
   of other ancient New Testament manuscripts in other languages.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are 8,000 to 10,000 Latin Vulgate manuscripts, plus a total
  </p>
  <p>
   of 8,000 in Ethiopic, Slavic, and Armenian. In all, there are
  </p>
  <p>
   about 24,000 manuscripts in existence.
  </p>
  <p>
   "What's your opinion, then?" I asked, wanting to confirm clearly
  </p>
  <p>
   what I thought I was hearing him say. "In terms of the
  </p>
  <p>
   multiplicity of manuscripts and the time gap between the
  </p>
  <p>
   originals and our first copies, how does the New Testament stack
  </p>
  <p>
   up against other well known  works of antiquity?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Extremely well," he replied. "We can have great confidence in
