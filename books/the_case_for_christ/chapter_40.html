  <p>
   the disciples faking one, this would mean they had a better
  </p>
  <p>
   understanding  of Jesus' predictions about his resurrection than
  </p>
  <p>
   the disciples did! After all, the disciples were surprised by the
  </p>
  <p>
   whole thing." "You've hit on something there," Craig conceded.
  </p>
  <p>
   "However,
  </p>
  <p>
   maybe they placed the guards there to prevent any sort of tomb
  </p>
  <p>
   robbery  or other disturbances from happening during Passover. We
  </p>
  <p>
   don't know. That's a good argument; I grant its full force. But I
  </p>
  <p>
   don't think it's insuperable."
  </p>
  <p>
   Yes, but it does raise some question concerning the guard story.
  </p>
  <p>
   Plus another objection came to mind. "Matthew says the Roman
  </p>
  <p>
   guards reported to the Jewish authorities," I said. "But doesn't
  </p>
  <p>
   that seem unlikely, since they were responsible to Pilate?"
  </p>
  <p>
   A slight smile came to Craig's face. "If you look carefully," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "Matthew doesn't say the guards are Romans. When the Jews
  </p>
  <p>
   go to Pilate and ask for a guard, Pilate says, 'You have a
  </p>
  <p>
   guard.' Now, does he mean, 'All right, here's a detachment of
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman soldiers'? Or does he mean, 'You've got your own temple
  </p>
  <p>
   guards; use them'? Scholars have debated whether or not it was a
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish guard. I was initially inclined, for the reason you
  </p>
  <p>
   mentioned, to think that the guard was Jewish. I've rethought
  </p>
  <p>
   that, however, because the word Matthew uses to refer to the
  </p>
  <p>
   guards is often used with respect to Roman soldiers rather than
  </p>
  <p>
   just temple officers.
  </p>
  <p>
   And remember, John tells us it was a Roman centurion who led
  </p>
  <p>
   Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus under the direction of Jewish
  </p>
  <p>
   leadership.  So there is precedent for Roman guards reporting to
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish religious  leaders. It seems plausible that they could
  </p>
  <p>
   also be involved in the guarding of the tomb."
  </p>
  <p>
   Weighing the evidence, I felt persuaded that guards had been
  </p>
  <p>
   present, but I decided to drop this line of questioning, since
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig doesn't rely on the guard story anyway. Meanwhile I was
  </p>
  <p>
   anxious to confront Craig with what seems to be the most
  </p>
  <p>
   persuasive argument against the idea that Jesus' tomb was vacant
  </p>
  <p>
   on Easter Morning.
  </p>
  <h2>
   WHAT ABOUT THE CONTRADICTIONS?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Through the years, critics of Christianity have attacked the
  </p>
  <p>
   empty tomb story by pointing out apparent discrepancies among the
  </p>
  <p>
   gospel accounts. For example, skeptic Charles Templeton said
  </p>
  <p>
   recently, "The four descriptions of events ... differ so markedly
  </p>
  <p>
   at so many points that, with all the good will in the world, they
  </p>
  <p>
   cannot be reconciled." Taken at face value, this objection seems
  </p>
  <p>
   to penetrate to the heart of the reliability of the empty tomb
  </p>
  <p>
   narratives. Consider this summary by Dr. Michael Martin of Boston
  </p>
  <p>
   University, which I read to Craig that morning:
  </p>
  <p>
   In Matthew, when Mary Magdalene and the other Mary arrived
  </p>
  <p>
   toward dawn at the tomb there is a rock in front of it, there is
  </p>
  <p>
   a violent earthquake, and an angel descends and rolls back the
  </p>
  <p>
   stone. In Mark, the women arrive at the tomb at sunrise and the
  </p>
  <p>
   stone had been rolled back. In Luke, when the women arrive at
  </p>
  <p>
   early dawn they find the stone had already been rolled back. In
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew, an angel is sitting on the rock outside the tomb and in
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark a youth is inside the tomb. In Luke, two men are inside. In
  </p>
  <p>
   Matthew, the women present at the tomb are Mary Magdalene  and
  </p>
  <p>
   the other Mary. In Mark, the women present at the
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb are the two Marys and Salome. In Luke, Mary Magdalene,  Mary
  </p>
  <p>
   the mother of James, Joanna, and the other women
  </p>
  <p>
   are present at the tomb.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Matthew, the two Marys rush from the tomb in great fear
  </p>
  <p>
   and joy, run to tell the disciples, and meet Jesus on the way. In
  </p>
  <p>
   Mark, they run out of the tomb in fear and say nothing to anyone.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Luke, the women report the story to the disciples who do not
  </p>
  <p>
   believe them and there is no suggestion that they meet Jesus .
  </p>
  <p>
   "And," I said to Craig, "Martin points out that John conflicts
  </p>
  <p>
   with much of the other three gospels. He concludes, 'In sum, the
  </p>
  <p>
   accounts of what happened at the tomb are either inconsistent or
  </p>
  <p>
   can only be made consistent with the aid of implausible
  </p>
  <p>
   interpretations.'" I stopped reading and looked up from my notes.
  </p>
  <p>
   My eyes locking with Craig's, I asked him point-blank, "In light
  </p>
  <p>
   of all this, how in the world can you possibly consider the empty
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb story to be credible?" Immediately I noticed something about
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig's demeanor. In
  </p>
  <p>
   casual conversation or when discussing tepid objections to the
  </p>
  <p>
   empty tomb, he's rather mellow. But the tougher the question and
  </p>
  <p>
   the more piercing the challenge, the more animated and focused he
  </p>
  <p>
   gets. And at this point his body language told me he couldn't
  </p>
  <p>
   wait to dive into these seemingly dangerous waters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clearing his throat, Craig began. "With all due respect," he
  </p>
  <p>
   said, "Michael Martin is a philosopher, not a historian, and I
  </p>
  <p>
   don't think he understands the historian's craft. For a
  </p>
  <p>
   philosopher, if something is inconsistent, the law of
  </p>
  <p>
   contradiction says, 'This cannot be true, throw it out!' However,
  </p>
  <p>
   the historian looks at these narratives and says, 'I see some
  </p>
  <p>
   inconsistencies, but I notice something about them: they're all
  </p>
  <p>
   in the secondary details.'
  </p>
  <p>
   The core of the story is the same: Joseph of Arimathea takes the
  </p>
  <p>
   body of Jesus, puts it in a tomb, the tomb is visited by a small
  </p>
  <p>
   group of women followers of Jesus early on the Sunday morning
  </p>
  <p>
   following his crucifixion, and they find that the tomb is empty.
  </p>
  <p>
   They see a vision of angels saying that Jesus is risen.
  </p>
  <p>
   The careful historian, unlike the philosopher, doesn't throw out
  </p>
  <p>
   the baby with the bathwater. He says, 'This suggests that there
  </p>
  <p>
   is a historical core to this story that is reliable and can be
  </p>
  <p>
   depended upon, however conflicting the secondary details might
  </p>
  <p>
   be.'
  </p>
  <p>
   "So we can have great confidence in the core that's common to the
  </p>
  <p>
   narratives and that would be agreed upon by the majority of New
  </p>
  <p>
   Testament scholars today, even if there are some differences
  </p>
  <p>
   concerning  the names of the women, the exact time of the
  </p>
  <p>
   morning, the number of the angels, and so forth. Those kinds of
  </p>
  <p>
   secondary discrepancies  wouldn't bother a historian."
  </p>
  <p>
   Even the usually skeptical historian Michael Grant, a fellow of
  </p>
  <p>
   Trinity College, Cambridge, and professor at Edinburgh
  </p>
  <p>
   University, concedes in his book Jesus: An Historian's Review of
  </p>
  <p>
   the Gospels, "True, the discovery of the empty tomb is
  </p>
  <p>
   differently described by the various gospels, but if we apply the
  </p>
  <p>
   same sort of criteria that we would apply to any other ancient
  </p>
  <p>
   literary sources, then the evidence is firm and plausible enough
  </p>
  <p>
   to necessitate the conclusion that the tomb was, indeed, found
  </p>
  <p>
   empty."
  </p>
  <h2>
   CAN DISCREPANCIES BE HARMONIZED?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   Sometimes while covering criminal trials, I've seen two witnesses
  </p>
  <p>
   give the exact same testimony, down to the nitty-gritty details,
  </p>
  <p>
   only to find themselves ripped apart by the defense attorney for
  </p>
  <p>
   having colluded before the trial. So I remarked to Craig, "I
  </p>
  <p>
   suppose if all four gospels were identical in all their minutiae,
  </p>
  <p>
   that would have raised the suspicion  of plagiarism."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, that's a very good point," he said. "The differences
  </p>
  <p>
   between the empty tomb narratives suggest that we have multiple,
  </p>
  <p>
   independent  attestation of the empty tomb story. Sometimes
  </p>
  <p>
   people say, 'Matthew and Luke just plagiarized from Mark,' but
  </p>
  <p>
   when you look at the narratives closely, you see divergences that
  </p>
  <p>
   suggest that even if Matthew and Luke did know Mark's account,
  </p>
  <p>
   nevertheless they also had separate, independent sources for the
  </p>
  <p>
   empty tomb story. So with these multiple and independent
  </p>
  <p>
   accounts, no historian would disregard this evidence just because
  </p>
  <p>
   of secondary discrepancies.  Let me give you a secular example.
  </p>
  <p>
   We have two narratives of Hannibal crossing the Alps to attack
  </p>
  <p>
   Rome, and they're incompatible and irreconcilable. Yet no
  </p>
  <p>
   classical historian doubts the fact that Hannibal did mount such
  </p>
  <p>
   a campaign. That's a nonbiblical illustration of discrepancies in
  </p>
  <p>
   secondary details failing to undermine the historical core of a
  </p>
  <p>
   historical story." I conceded the power of that argument. And as
  </p>
  <p>
   I reflected on Martin's  critique, it seemed to me that some of
  </p>
  <p>
   his alleged contradictions could be rather easily reconciled. I
  </p>
  <p>
   mentioned this to Craig by saying,  "Aren't there ways to
  </p>
  <p>
   harmonize some of the differences among these accounts?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Yes, that's right, there are," Craig replied. "For example, the
  </p>
  <p>
   time of the visit to the tomb. One writer might describe it as
  </p>
  <p>
   still being dark, the other might be saying it was getting light,
  </p>
  <p>
   but that's sort of like the optimist and the pessimist arguing
  </p>
  <p>
   over whether the glass was half empty or half full. It was around
  </p>
  <p>
   dawn, and they were describing the same thing with different
  </p>
  <p>
   words.
  </p>
  <p>
   As for the number and names of the women, none of the gospels
  </p>
  <p>
   pretend to give a complete list. They all include Mary Magdalene
  </p>
  <p>
   and other women, so there was probably a gaggle of these early
  </p>
  <p>
   disciples that included those who were named and probably a
  </p>
  <p>
   couple of others. I think it would be pedantic to say that's a
  </p>
  <p>
   contradiction." "What about the different accounts of what
  </p>
  <p>
   happened afterward?" I asked. "Mark said the women didn't tell
  </p>
  <p>
   anybody, and the other gospels say they did."
  </p>
  <p>
   Craig explained, "When you look at Mark's theology, he loves to
  </p>
  <p>
   emphasize awe and fright and terror and worship in the presence
  </p>
  <p>
   of the divine. So this reaction of the women-of fleeing with fear
  </p>
  <p>
   and trembling, and saying nothing to anyone because they were
  </p>
  <p>
   afraidis  all part of Mark's literary and theological style.
  </p>
  <p>
   It could well be that this was a temporary silence, and then the
  </p>
  <p>
   women went back and told the others what had happened. In fact,"
  </p>
  <p>
   he concluded with a grin, "it had to be a temporary silence;
  </p>
  <p>
   otherwise Mark couldn't be telling the story about it!"
  </p>
  <p>
   I wanted to ask about one other commonly cited discrepancy.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Jesus said in Matthew 12:40, 'For as Jonah was three days and
  </p>
  <p>
   three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will
  </p>
  <p>
   be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.'
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the gospels report that Jesus was really in the tomb one
  </p>
  <p>
   full day, two full nights, and part of two days. Isn't this an
  </p>
  <p>
   example of Jesus being wrong in not fulfilling  his own
  </p>
  <p>
   prophecy?"
  </p>
  <p>
   "Some well-meaning Christians have used this verse to suggest
  </p>
  <p>
   Jesus was crucified on Wednesday rather than on Friday, in order
  </p>
  <p>
   to get the full time in there!" Craig said. "But most scholars
  </p>
  <p>
   recognize that according to early Jewish time-reckoning, any part
  </p>
  <p>
   of a day counted as a full day. Jesus was in the tomb Friday
  </p>
  <p>
   afternoon, all day Saturday, and on Sunday morning-under the way
  </p>
  <p>
   the Jews conceptualized  time back then, this would have counted
  </p>
  <p>
   as three days.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Again," he concluded, "that's just another example of how many
  </p>
  <p>
   of these discrepancies can be explained or minimized with some
  </p>
  <p>
   background  knowledge or by just thinking them through with an
  </p>
  <p>
   open mind."
  </p>
  <h2>
   CAN THE WITNESSES BE TRUSTED?
  </h2>
  <br/>
  <p>
   The gospels agree that the empty tomb was discovered by women who
  </p>
  <p>
   were friends and followers of Jesus. But that, in Martin's
  </p>
  <p>
   estimation, makes their testimony suspect, since they were
  </p>
  <p>
   "probably not objective  observers."
  </p>
  <p>
   So I put the question to Craig: "Does the women's relationship
  </p>
  <p>
   with Jesus call the reliability of their testimony into
  </p>
  <p>
   question?" Unwittingly I had played right into Craig's hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Actually, this argument backfires on people who use it," Craig
  </p>
  <p>
   said in response. "Certainly these women were friends of Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>
   But when you understand  the role of women in first-century
  </p>
  <p>
   Jewish society, what's really extraordinary is that this empty
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb story should feature women as the discoverers of the empty
  </p>
  <p>
   tomb in the first place.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Women were on a very low rung of the social ladder in first-
  </p>
  <p>
   century  Palestine. There are old rabbinical sayings that said,
  </p>
  <p>
   'Let the words of the Law be burned rather than delivered to
  </p>
  <p>
   women' and 'Blessed is he whose children are male, but woe to him
  </p>
  <p>
   whose children are female.' Women's testimony was regarded as so
  </p>
  <p>
   worthless that they weren't even allowed to serve as legal
  </p>
  <p>
   witnesses in a Jewish court of law. In light of this, it's
