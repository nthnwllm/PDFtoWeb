# PDF to Web

## Overview

**PDF to Web** is a Python project that transforms PDF documents into web-friendly HTML pages. This tool is particularly useful for converting eBooks and other large PDF files into a series of organized, navigable web pages. Each chapter of the PDF is converted into its own HTML page, complete with a chapter header, navigation buttons, and a collapsible side menu for easy access to other chapters.

## Features

- **Chapter-based Conversion:** Breaks down the PDF into chapters, each represented as a separate HTML page.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and mobile-friendly design using modern web technologies.
- **Hamburger Navigation Menu:** Collapsible side menu for easy navigation between chapters.
- **Header and Footer:** Each page includes a customizable header and footer with book details.
- **JavaScript Integration:** Includes a `script.js` file for dynamic functionalities such as the hamburger menu.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyMuPDF (`pip install PyMuPDF`)
- BeautifulSoup4 (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd PDFtoWeb
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv PDFtoWebEnv
   source PDFtoWebEnv/bin/activate  # On Windows: PDFtoWebEnv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Place your PDF**: Move your PDF file into the project directory (e.g., `D:/projects/python_projects/PDFtoWeb/`).

2. **Run the conversion script**:

   Modify the `driver.py` script to point to your PDF file and adjust settings such as the number of pages per chapter.

   ```bash
   python driver.py
   ```

3. **Access the generated HTML files**:

   The generated HTML files will be placed in a folder inside `books/` with the same name as the PDF. You can open `index.html` in your browser to see the list of books and start reading.

## Customization

- **Style**: Modify `style.css` to change the appearance of the chapter pages. Use `index.css` for the home page styling.
- **Script**: Update `script.js` for any additional JavaScript functionality you wish to add.
- **Book Details**: Customize the footer information in the `convert_text_to_html` function within `driver.py`.
